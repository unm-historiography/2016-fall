1. After reading about all the different historians in chapter five and learning that many of them, such as Jordanes, who wrote about the Goths (p. 107), and Nennius, who wrote about the Britons (p. 112), fabricated and exaggerated much of what they recorded as the histories of different cultures, **is it fair to assume that a majority of what they recorded and what we know today does not accurately represent these groups?** 

2. On p. 104, Kelley states that “Barbarism was a term bestowed by classical authors on all peoples outside the bright circles of Greek and Roman culture…these nations had their own forms of wisdom, but as Diogenes Laertius argued, none of these deserved to be ranked with Greek philosophy.” **If this was the attitude of many pre-modern historians, how much of these groups’ beliefs, philosophies, laws, etc. were left out of their documented histories?** 

3. Kelley discusses on pp. 105-106 how the Goths were represented by Isidore and other future historians in a way that highlighted their military triumphs, and how they were feared by “all the peoples of Europe,” despite the fact that they had many major setbacks and showed a great deal of mercy when conquering Rome. **Why did these historians feel it was important to portray the Goths in this way? Was it to show how “barbaric” they really were?**
