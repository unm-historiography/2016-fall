 1. History was *secular* in methodology, but it was surviving in a *Christian* world. It had to place nations, kings, battles, etc. into the **Universal Chronology** of Christian belief. History was considered at the time, an auxilary art, and was the lowest in the intellectual hierarchy of the Christians. (Pg 101) There was a problem in the Middle Ages of not enough individuals **recording contemporary history** as mentioned by *Peter the Venerable*. (Pg 101) This problem according to Peter, there would be a "sterile silence" in his section of history (12th century). (Pg 101)

 2. A revival of history began to occur around this time, and the **methodology** of history began to take shape during Middle Ages.  *Historians* during this time began to create a distinction between *original authors* and *copyists and compilers*. (Pg 103) The quetioning of sources became a major subject of debate as well, with certain histories being regarded as **fiction** if they didn't hold up to the scrutiny of historical canon. (Pgs 113,123) 
 
 3. **Mythistory** was a major problem for this period, but was beginning to be reigned in by **Historians** who began to call such stories **Fiction**. (Pg 123) They allowed some forms of *Mythistory* to remain, e.g. origins in Troy, so that they can place their nations within the **Universal Chronology**. Many historians during the Middle Ages continued to create *Mythistory* for their nations and the church, because these allowed them to have closer connections with the Ancient World, to claim *legitimacy*. (Pg 111-118)
 
 4. **National Histories** were created during the Middle Ages, to create a sense of unity for a people and to legitimize their rulers. The stories of France, England, Germany, Spain, and the Papacy all wrote histories that laid their national foundations with ties to either *Rome*, *Troy*, or with *St. John*. These ties to the ancients is what gave their rule legitimacy, and unitied their nations, to become the French, Germans, English, etc.(Pg 117,118) This multitude of *national histories* also displays the **diversity** of the histories being written during the Middle Ages, more so than any previous time in history. (Pg 129)
 
 5. The difference between the **Chronicler** and the **Historian** was discussed during the Middle Ages. (Pg 120, 121) The difference was between those *who wrote down what events happened during "the year of our lord"* ,the **Chroniclers**, and those who wrote down *why these events happened and what the truth was*, the **Historians**. (Pg 120)
