1.	Medieval history was a legitimate field, but was grounded in rhetoric and the liberal arts, along with philosophy and theology, to which it remained inextricably linked.

2.	The Goths were a persistent and unconquered presence in Europe, and had been a serious threat even to the mighty Roman Empire.  This forced Roman and Christian scholars to not only acknowledge them, rather than leave them out of history, but also to question the superiority of Greco-Roman civilizations to the “barbarians.”

3.	Jordanes was one of the few who acknowledged the Goth’s own history and traditions, and even compared them to the Greeks.  This made him something of a pariah to later historians, not least because Gothic history was not physically recorded, and in fact they had no written law.

4.	The fall of the Roman Empire gave rise to other civilizations, like the Scots and Saxons, in areas once under its control.  This subsequently led to countless historians from all over Europe attempting to fit themselves into the universal chronology of the world.  
5.	The primary task of medieval chroniclers was basically to keep a record of the Years of Our Lord, placing the importance of historical events in context with sacred ones.  

6.	History in the Middle Ages became more closely tied to theology, and less utilitarian.  Reading “real” history was largely a luxury of the aristocracy, while most common people were illiterate, and everything they learned was translated and read to them by the clergy.
