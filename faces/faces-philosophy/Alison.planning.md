  Since a website allows for the audience to navigate more freely and there will be common themes within several time periods, we could provide the ability to navigate by themes as a secondary capability. For instance we could have both the time frames and the themes on a side bar. **The chronological info being a table of contents and the themes more of a glossary**. The theme links would lead to pages that summarizes each time period's relationship to that theme. Shorter than the actual chronological chapter information just like a glossary would.
