  - The Middle Ages marked the emergence of Renaissance humanism, the scholars had a deep appreciation of historiography and a strong sense of the past. That said, "this historical sense was selective and subordinate to deep religious commitments and inhibitions..." (130)


- Petrarch, in his epic poem Africa, celebrated both antiquity and a vision of posterity, "In a posture that was at once ancient and modern, he took both origins, and goals, both a remote antiquity and idealized future, into his conception of history." (131) "It is said that he died, as if sleeping, with his face in a book--as usual, looking forward, backward, and no doubt inward." (135)


- 15th century historian Bruni insisted on documentary sources and, "broke with precedent by focusing on the "known history of this city" and rejecting Danes of Trojan foundations, the destruction by Totila, and subsequent Carolingian restoration." (139)

- In Renaissance France, "It was Thucydides' gaze that dominated mainstream history in the Renaissance." (141). In the spirit of Thucydides the preoccupation of most chroniclers and historians of the time was political and military history--newsworthy deeds such as conquest and war. (142)

- The idea of a national tradition grows in importance with many historians and chroniclers focusing on it, "Perhaps the most significant figure in this national tradition, in retrospect at least, was the royal secretary and archivist Jean Du Tillet, who not only made a critical analysis of French origins (discarding the old Trojan myths in favor of a Germanic progeny) but also assembled a comprehensive inventory of the legislative, ecclesiastical, and diplomatic records of the monarchy." (146)


- Continuing the dominance of the Thucydidean style, "Both Guicciardini and Machiavelli wrote in a Thucydidean mode--inspired by political crisis and failure and impelled to seek out the causes of--and perhaps even remedies for--their predicament. Political realism and moral cynicism were by-products of the flood of historical literature produced by the invasion of the 1494 and its calamitous aftermath." (151)

- Herodotus was not without influence though, "Herodotus also became a presence in the sense that his view of the office of the historian attracted not a few authors." (152). These historians went beyond the political and military actions that dominated the interest of their peers, and focused on, "all the arts and sciences of humanist learning." (152)
