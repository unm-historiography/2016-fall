- Through the description of Petrarch in the beginning of the chapter, Kelly provided an example of how **national and cultural biases can affect the way we write history**. The focal point being the prejudice with which Petrarch saw and wrote of Charlemagne and the Barbarians (132).

- Kelley mentions how **pre-histories can bind together a people, seemingly as much as a "real" history**.(136) Just because there may not be proof of these events does not mean that they can't be a rallying point or common ground for people.

- Villani is an example of writing histories for the future. Villani is quoted with the following phrase, that provide us with one of the motives for his writing of history: **"'That in the future men of knowledge may be able to increase the prosperity of Florence.'"** (137)

- The attitude of Spain on the dawn of the New World (158), according to Kelly, is similar to how Jenkins described how history is recorded and how some events and people are chosen and others left out. It supports the theory of history being written by the elite.
