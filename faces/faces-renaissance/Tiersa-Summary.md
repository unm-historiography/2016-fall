- Kelley discusses how the Middle Ages introduced a history that had a *“discriminating perspective on the ancient world”* (p. 130) but Petrarch of the Renaissance was fascinated with the ancients. Petrarch introduced a historiography that was concerned with *“specific cultural moments in the past”* that was meant to be **understood** and **imitated**. His view of history is best quoted as **“looking _forward_, _backward_, and no doubt _inward_”** (p. 135). 


- Historiography during the Renaissance had a more *“humanist and rhetorical conception of history”* (p. 140).  Their history was written to **restore** ancient models and to **adapt** history to their modern needs.


- French historians were similar to Thucydides in that they devoted their work to **political history**. They were interested in **memorable** and **newsworthy events** concerned with war and government institutions. Political history of France embodied in what Seyssel called *“religion, justice, and the polity”* (p. 144).


- Machiavelli and Guicciardini had **secular ways** of understanding history. History took a *“new route”* in which past events were seen as **shedding light on the _future_**.


- Cultural history examined the history of *different* peoples (ie Chinese, Indians, etc.). History of cultures was described as having **three stages**; *Nature, Prudence and Government, and wisdom and literature* (p. 155). 


- The discovery of the *New World* introduced a dilemma for historians. They needed to find a way to include two new continents into their history. History would soon turn into a **“truly _global_ history”** (p. 161).
