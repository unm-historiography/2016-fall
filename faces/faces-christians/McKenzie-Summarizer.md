1. Christianity took what was once *earthly* things and made them into *heavenly* things.  Developing a relationship between pagan and Christian events created a bridge between the two.  Modern historical writings spawned from the development of this bridge.
  
  -Early Christians probably asked themselves; why, what, when, where, and why as they record important events, much like a historian would do today.

2. Christian writings were the beginning of what we would consider to be **modern history**.  It was important to get the dates and events right, and made converting from “*barbarians*” to Christians easier.

3. Early writings taught Christians and Jewish people through enlightenment.  The Bible was not only the word of God (**Truth**), it was their book of morals and regulations as well.

4. Kelley mentions truth again in this chapter.  This time, the truth was more of a spiritual awakening, rather than knowledge-finding (Greek and Romans).

5. Although all of Christian writing is written in favor of their legitimacy, their style of recording events created the foundation for historical documents today.
