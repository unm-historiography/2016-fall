<b> Faces of History </b> <br>
<i> Summary </i> <br>
Pg. 75-98<br><br>

1.	<b>Religion</b> plays a part in history that has its own agenda. An <b>agenda</b> based on “fate” or a “providential plan” (Kelley 75).<br><br>
2.	Herbert Butterfield said “Israel attached itself to the God of History rather than the God of Nature”, as the <b>Jewish history</b> was highly depended of the future or “prophecy” (76). – The interesting thing here is the separation between what “God” is and what a “Myth” is.<br><br>
3.	“<b>Judaism</b> turned national history into universal history” (81). “Truth” isn’t just what is factual or right but it is literally the “Word of God”, and the author writes, “[truth] must be obeyed on the grounds of authority” (81). – “Christianity … centers on the question of how to make sense of the past” (84).<br><br>
4.	And so we meet the various forms of historians again critiquing each other. Until we meet <b>Augustine</b> who feels the need to sort history from prophesy (90). Eventually Augustine died after shedding some light on the musings of separating God from Man, or at least recognizing the “dualities of human life – body and soul, real and ideal, material [from] grace,” and so on (91). The bigger picture being <b><i>the education of the human race</b></i>. After his death comes yet another critiquing or adding of history to history from Orosius.<br><br>
5.	To wrap things up, we have more words from Augustine interpreted by the author for us “Thus history itself was not a matter of words but… <b>a creation of God</b>” (95). Perfect. <br><br>
6.	“Historical dimensions of humanity and the historical mode of textual interpretation” … (98)? Apparently this is what Renaissance scholars did… and the author calls them “meta-historians” …Sounds a lot like what we are doing in class, still. But now we are free to do these things to them… <b><i>So, what does that make us?</b></i><br><br>
