-Can we judge the quality of historical narrative not by comparison to an arbitrary notion of truth but rather the extent to which it satisfies our sense of curiosity about the world or how well it answers a question or series of questions for us?

-Different individuals have different requirements for them to be satisfied about a question they have about the world. With this in mind and given our discussion about the interpretive nature of historiographical narrative and thus history itself (according to Jenkins) is all history some form of collective memory that is passed through innumerable prejudicial lenses or can the theory of relativity apply as equally to history as it does to quantum physics? 

-History is different for every person…ever…we are all simultaneously contributors to/creators of history and witnesses/spectators of an incalculable variety of historical threads.

-Let us expand on the notion of history being a series of imitations and interpretations by a sympathetic audience. If history is relative and exists within the realm of opinion…historians can pick and choose from existing pieces of historiography that satisfy their curiosity about an aspect of the world.
