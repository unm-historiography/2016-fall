The effort to ascertain a “true” history began with Herodotus and Thucydides.  With this beginning also came the emergence 
of varying methodology.  Both developed a language and an approach that they utilized to uncover a “true” history, and their 
methods may be reminiscent of tools we would recognize.  While discussing their differing approaches to history, you begin to
see the makings of what will become the conflict between historians to come.  Herodotus would use hearsay as evidence of truth
whereas Thucydides would not.  Herodotus wrote history that covered a long span of time and a variety of topics with 
seemingly little depth.  Thucydides on the other hand wrote a shorter history about a few topics with what some said is a 
lot of depth.  Here we see the same divergence that historians experience today.  Overtime many different methods have either 
fallen into or out of favor in history.  All claimed to be the best way to discover the truth.  Further the questions that 
divide and haunt historians even now evolves largely from the divergent methods Herodotus and Thucydides employed.  
Questions such as: what is a “true” history?, how does one go about discovering “true” history?, can a historian ever 
achieve a truly subjective history?, or what is more important breath or depth?.  These are all questions that are still 
debated now.  If they weren’t, then quite frankly it would seem that the current course we are taking becomes useless.  
Just as we saw in *Rethinking History* the divide between methodology sparks a discussion, more research, and more literature.
Following Herodotus and Thucydides historians critiqued or praised the men’s approach, and then proceeded to model themselves
at least in part by the one they thought got it right.  Essentially the beginning of Faces seems to be showing us that 
debating methodology, the truth of history, and the accuracy of a historian has been going on since the birth of history 
as a discipline.
