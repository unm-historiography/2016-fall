Kelley says that myth and history are linked, and goes on to say that some modern scholars argue that “myth has a historical face and that history has not been quite the promoter of absolute truth which it so often claimed to be.” Is there really a significant difference between history and myth? 

In his approach Herodotus attempts to capture the more distant past as well as the cultural history of many different areas.  Thucydides on the other hand concentrates on his own time and the experiences specific to his generation and culture.  Is one of these goals more attainable or are they equally impossible? 

Kelley states that “history need not be tied to chronology,” however history generally is presented chronologically.  How would our view of history be different if chronology was not used? How would questions of causality be approached without the guidelines of chronology?
