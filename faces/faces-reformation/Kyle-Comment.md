1. It's quite interesting how closely politics is tied to the Catholic church in Europe at this time, and we can see a direct correlation to political and religious responses to Rome's influence on the rest of Europe. This is directly tied to the search for ancient legitimacy and truth found within the discussion of the great schism. The Great Schism is a bigger historical event, not only for Christianity, but for histiorography and the National Traditions of many European "Nations".

2. The battle for truth between Reformist Christians and Counter-Reformists is a struggle that lies with "tradition". The Catholic Church obviously had an upper hand with its long history, but the Protestants used this long history to their advantage. They accused the Church of silencing the "truth" of the ancient church. It was surprising that they used a long tradition as a disadvantage for the Catholic Church.

3. The response of new National Traditions within Europe is just a continuation of the long story of European nations searching for ways to legitimize their rule over the "nations" they created. As history became a true profession during this time, we see History continually being looked to for finding legitimacy for the Kings and Queens of Europe.
