- There was a duality of church and state in Europe which had conflicting interests and both claimed authority.  (pg. 163). These were the two sources of historiography, each using history to claim power and sovereignty.

- Reformation scholarship and history **undermined the idea of a universal Christian history** and narrative. (pg. 169). The reformation may be similar to the discovery of the Americas in that both events drastically changed the way that history was viewed. Changed the worldview of western society. 

- Scholarship with opposing viewpoints leads to **more critical evaluation of sources**.  Kelley describes how with the arrival of reformation thinking affected source criticism “*rival interpretations provoked not only confusion and discord among parties but also massive investigation into the sources of medieval and early Christian history.*” (pg. 170).

- Historians began to write **Protestant martyrologies in imitation of the early church**. (pg. 172).  Emulating the early church as a way of backing up the idea that they were not creating a new church but were returning the church to its original state.

- Kelley describes a reaction against Rome, this includes a **rejection of traditional Roman-based origin myths and the creation of new myths based on the barbarian past**. “*None of these later sixteenth century historians accepted the royalist myths of Trojan origins and alleged Carolingian creations, but new mythical constructs had arisen to replace the old ones.*” (pg. 179).  The new ideals of the Reformation influenced the way nations wrote their histories.
