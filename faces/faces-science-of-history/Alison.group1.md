- During the Renaissance, **history was an extension of the humanities**, such as rhetoric and grammar. It was often used as a source of examples for these other studies(189). It was also called the only "Self-sufficient field." by Daniel Heinsius, though Kelley considered this to be a bit exessive(192).

- Kelley introduces the early stages of source criticism. He mentions that **context was being held in a higher level of importance** in relation to understanding sources.(205)

- History was being praised for its human components as well as its existence as an "Encyclopedia of the arts."(197)
