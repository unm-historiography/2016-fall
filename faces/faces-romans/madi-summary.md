- Roman historical writing had the Roman tradition and the location of the capital as a central point of focus. “The Romans measured time ‘from the founding of the city,’ and for them space was centered likewise on the city.” (pg. 48).

- Interest in history was partially based on the belief that a complete understanding of the present required an understanding of the past and of ‘origins.’  For example Ennius states that “For long lapse of time has rendered old words and customs obsolete, and it is in the light of those words and customs that the sense of the laws is to be understood.” (pg. 51).

- Several Roman authors, unlike some of their predecessors, focused only on human factors of history, leaving out the mythical and supernatural from their accounts. (pg. 54).

- With the change from Paganism to Christianity within the Roman Empire the historical writing of Romans was inevitably influenced by Christian ideals and beliefs. (pg. 70).

- Preservation of classical historical works through Eastern Byzantine Empire and eventual rediscovery of these texts in Western society.  “In this Greek phase of the Italian Renaissance, the classical Greek idea of history, with attendant attitudes and assumptions, rejoined the mainstream of Western historiography.” (pg. 73).
