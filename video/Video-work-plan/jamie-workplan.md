Video Work Plan

November 11th, 2016

Before November 14th: I’ve made videos before. For previous assignments I used my phone to record the audio, and Windows Movie Maker to put it together with my images and set up transitions. My plan is to use that method again. It’s simple and it works well.
Style of video: Audio accompanying memes, gifs, and images. I want to take a fun and lighthearted tone like Crash Course History.

* November 14th: Have book read.
* November 15th-20th: Make/revise notes and write first draft of script following audio timestamps in video proposal.
* November 20th- 23rd: Choose images and memes to accompany audio.
* November 24th-25th: Make first draft of video.
* November 25th-28th: Edit first draft of video; post on Youtube for November 28th deadline.
