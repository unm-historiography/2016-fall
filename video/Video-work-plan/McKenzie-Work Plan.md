# Video Work Plan

##### Purpose
Create a video book review that not only summarizes *The Cheese and Worms* by Carlo Ginzburg, but goes more in-depth.  I want to help viewers understand my book, without having to read boring reports and summaries.

##### Objectives and Goals
The goal is to give others a solid understanding of *The Cheese and Worms*.  My objectives are to make the viewer more interested in the material, teach students how to analyze a book, and also to practice a form of communication I've never used before.

#####Achievability
I'd like to devote about an hour a day to this book, in order to finish it by Sunday (11/20). I'd like to create a prezi for my book review, and record over my presentation.  There are three programs I'm considering; Jing, Camtasia, and Icecream Screen Reader.
