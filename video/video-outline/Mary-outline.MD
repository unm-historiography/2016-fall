I am doing my video project on “Histories of the Holocaust” by Dan Stone. 

I have just begun to read the book. I will probably base the video production on the same sequence the book takes. 
The book is divided into 6 chapters. The first six are the names of the chapters of the book. These are not my words. I will probably spend 45 seconds to one minute of video time on each. Thirty seconds giving an overview of the chapter and thirty seconds of historiographical analysis of the chapter. 


1.	Introduction- “Towards an Integrated Historiography of the Holocaust”

2.	The ‘Final Solution’: A German or European Project

3.	The Holocaust: Child of Modernity

4.	Race Science: The Basis of the Nazi World View

5.	Genocide, the Holocaust and the History of Colonialism

6.	The Holocaust as an expression of Nazi culture

7.	Overarching historical themes- Author bias, use of sources?

8.	Overview of the book from a historiographical perspective: which type of analysis is used, who are the key historians, historiographical context

9.	Critique of the book- what was done well, what could have been done better- 45 seconds to one minute

10.	Conclusion- one minute.

I have not yet decided what I want the video to look like. I would like a simple streamlined production. I will be using Camtasia to produce this video.
