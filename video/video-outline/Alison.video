I plan on using Prezi to complete the visual components to my video. I will likely go by chapter and discuss each one prior to looking at the full book. I will Use Prezi to given each cheapter a circle/section. From there I will have subsections dedicated to each of the authors and the review of the text itself. Palmer uses a group of historians and walk through different stages of their lives and influences in regards to their writing of history.
