PS: If you get more views than Wurtz by the end of the semester, you get an automatic A for the course. Note that his techniques are not technically sophisticated (all are standard tools in free editing software we've discussed); but it's obviously highly creative, educational, and entertaining. Your final videos may not be as clever, but it's nice to have something to aim for.
