1. On page 163, Kelley used the term **“two swords”** to refer to the *domination* the crown and the church held over the 
development and perspective of history.  Given the profoundly **anti-hierarchical stance** of the Reformation, how did the 
Reformation transform the influence of the crown and church?
  1. the Reformation presented ideas that undermined **the foundations** of both government and the church how does that play 
     out in the writing of history?
  2. does the Reformation change the **elitism** we have seen thus far in history?
1. On page 171 Kelley explains that Protestants just as many groups before them had to find a way to **construct** their 
history or their origins.  This is certainly not new, but is it **different** from before?
  1. when Romans were looking for their origins it seems obvious that the Romans as a people had origins somewhere, for 
    Protestants their origins would seem to be the Reformation but that’s not how they wrote it 
  2. does that make the Protestants search for their **“origins”** different from the Romans?
