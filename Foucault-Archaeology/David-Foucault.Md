The most notable thing about Foucault and his *Archaeology of history*, in comparison to our previous readings, is that he is dense. Reading his writing is like trying to swim through Magma. I would not recommend it, you could not do it, and it would hurt to try.

I felt the need to say that, solely for the sake of my own sanity. Anna Green is a very, very good writer, and I've been spoiled.

His point seems to be describing the effects of "scientific" history on the discipline, and the results of that fields proliferation.

He relates the mechanism in which history has lost it's large term viewpoint. Instead of analysis of the totality of history, we see an analysis which seeks to deliniate and limit history. This prevents the "speculation" that resulted in *"universal"* history, focusing more on a history of *particulars* (9-10)

Second, we see history being separated into discrete sections, **Discontinuities**, which is the basis of the above. By breaking history into descrete fields-economics, sociology, politics-there is both specialization *and* an artifical blindness to interconnected events. Where history was supposed to connect things, now it separates them, a major switch in trend.

Finally, his first point is that history has become obsessed with defining, categorizing, and separating these discontinuities. Maybe. He really is terrible at saying his point in simple english in a single, discrete paragraph.

Oh, and also, he details how methodology and the way history is done has become central and forthright in the field, as individaul sub-fields can be defined simply by *how they do analysis* (not his point, but mine). The methodological problems aren't new, but the emphasis on the solutions and the quest to find a *perfect* way to analyize the past to, as an analogy, *steralize* it is new(ish).

In essence, what we see here is an analysis and reaction (explicit of implicit, I believe a negative viewpoint is there) against scientific histories, because they remove the imposition of cohesion and meaning on historical analysis. As these methods of doing history proliferate, historical analysis becomes focused on particulars, on that which can be objectively analyzed and conclusions processed.


This is where I start on a prolonged tangent.


In this, as a Scientist, I see a curious **contrast* with how science takes particular knowledge and synthesizes it into larger picture conclusions. Most scientific work is as particular, as narrowly focused, as scientific history is.

But then further scientists *build* on that, reading our work, and use that sub-set of knowledge to form larger hypothesis and conclusions. Textbooks, summery papers, conferences, and similar modes of communication *synthesize* large bodies of knowledge into a complete view of reality; thus, Geology has a coherent *general picture* of how the world works, despite all the analysis being on specific minuate trivia. 

Where Foucault has some legitimancy as a *general* message about *all* sciences is that what he calls *general* versus *universal* is there to see in all scientific fields. History seems to be picking up on this; just as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Sociology, etc. are all distinct sciences, we see distinct historical fields. Yet at the same time, in the developed sciences, we see clear overlap in certain fields to form a *total view of the world*, or at least the *beginnings of it*; a theory of the universe.

History lacks a similarly complete "theory of history" as distinct from the "theory of economic history" of marx, the theories that result from the annals and quantitative histories, the theories of the disadvantaged, etc.

"Scientific" History (and history in general) has the same textbooks, academic journals, and thus process which can synthesize a larger view, yet the epistemological problems are greater. In a science publication, you can show, on review, that someone's conclusion is wrong by doing the same experiment. In a historical publication, there isn't the same capacity for falsification. Not every even agrees if falsification is the *point* of history, if *truth* is the goal, if *truth* is possible. There isn't even agreement that history is a science to begin with, in that sense.

Hence, History seems to stand in contrast to my experience with sciences due to it's lack of a working process for synthesizing the paticular into the general. That's what I noticed on reading about the Archaeology of history, and it's larger themes.
