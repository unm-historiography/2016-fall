Withers discusses the different ways of conceptualising place.  Place can be seen as a consequence of social processes, a socially constructed idea which creates a sense of place, alternatively place is seen as preexisting and it shapes society and social structures.  The idea of place goes beyond just a ‘space’, it is an area defined by the specific social and cultural practices that happen within it.  Withers also explains the idea of place as a *“symptom of the Enlightenment’s interest in rationalizing order.”* (pg 655).  The place, or more specifically the **‘sense of place’**, was a way to organize the world and to create a structure within which other ideas could be discussed.


Withers explains that some believe that there was a devaluation of place in the social sciences and then a subsequent revitalisation of the inclusion of place.  However, Withers disagrees, stating that the social sciences had a continual focus on place, and needed place in order to develop.  Specifically, he discusses how historical study relied on *“recognition of place as locale, upon places as connected settings, upon place consciousness as much as they were upon an argument about different time-scales within historical explanation.”* (pg 646).  For Withers, the study of place and of the connection between places has always been an important part of historical practice.  Place has not been neglected, but is an integral part of historical study.
