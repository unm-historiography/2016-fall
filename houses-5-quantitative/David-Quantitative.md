Quantitative history is an elaboration and progression, again, from empiricism. It seems that all of these methods are.

It appears, at it's core, that quantitative history is about assigning numbers to history. Statistics, GDP, etc. are all given as examples. However it also contains an element of almost scientific (truly scientific) analysis. The Annals utilized mathematical trends to form conclusions. Empircism looks at data. Quantitiative analysis, at least as done by Lockridge and Davis, was about following the scientific method, at least as understood by the modern world.

1. Research a subject and define context.

2. Formula a model (a hypothesis) of the world as relevant to your subject.

3. Conduct a test, which can prove your model false.

Science, at it's core, is the second and third. Form a hypothesis, test that hypothesis. The first is neccessary to provide imputus for the second to actually occur. No inquiry exists until you've questioned the world first.

The concerns raised point out the **fundemental flaws** with this analysis as applied to history.

At it's core, history deals with things that **cannot be tested**. I can't create a world where railroads don't exist. If I could, I'm a God, time to start worshipping me.

Furthermore, the first step and the third step, in science, are different things. You can clearly deliniate where you begin to preform **new research**, as opposed to merely doing "research" in the form of **analyzing a body of literature**. In history, as *all* research is analyzing a body of literature, this isn't possible.

Hence, the lack of the ability to preform **actual experiments** is the main flaw of this form of Quantiative history. 

Of course, it's a flaw in all history. The main thing preventing us from understanding why the past occurred is seeing how things could be different. This is why the discussion of history as merely a form of literature, not a science, are valid. This is why hisory **isn't** a science.

On the other hand, **that's not neccessiarily true**.

Everything I just said assumes that you cannot test the path, cannot test your models. In the absolutely trivial sense, this is true. I can't create a world where, as per the reading, the English stopped having live in servants. 

However what I **could** do is trying to find a society with similar economic situations, and view how **their** demographics responded. I could compare, quantitatively, incidents where two **equivilent but different** things occurred historically.

The problem then becomes common methodological issues in science; making sure you control independent variables and thus your equivilency is equivilent. And, additionally, ensuring your experiment is **possible**.

If there exists no equivilent society, no dataset that contrasts the subjects in question, I'm screwed. It's like if I wanted to preform an experiment where I isolated anti-matter perfectly and played with it-all well and good, but I can't physically **do that**, so it's wasted words.

In other words; if there is a way to get truth from history, this is it. But you can't always get truth from history.

Statistics is a method of compensating for imperfect control and imperfect experiments, attempting to correct for a suite of unknown variables and non-deterministic results by using probability to show that, even if there *are* unknowns, they aren't "signficiant". It has it's own host of problems, but it a useful tool when you realize what it is.

As an aside, I thought that the example given, with demographics, was useful but did not clearly state it's hypothesis in places, and often lacked a hypothesis and simply described demographic series through time. Which makes it a perfect example of all three parts of quantitative analysis talked about; demographics, series analysis, and the pseudo-scientific counter-factual modeling.

At least, that is my impression of the method. It's limited, and I'm focusing on only the parts that I, as a scientist, feel kinship with. But there it is.
