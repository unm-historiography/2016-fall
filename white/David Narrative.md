A lot of our previous discussions have to do with the relation between history and truth. The question of narrative is intertwined with this, due to questions of objectivity.

As White says, in some sense an annal, without "narrative" (or rather, with poorly acknowledged narrative) is more "true" or "objective" than a more narrative account, yet lacks the narrative to create *meaning* for these "real" accounts. It is precisiely the "meaning" which we need and desire in historical accounts-and why chronicles and history are viewed as "higher" forms. Chronicles lack a terminating "doneness" to history, but still impose some narrative-this lack of final narrative is where they "fail" as histories.

(At least, this is how I read him).

To diverge slightly, this is how Maps, Territory, and Science relate to reality.

Any Map of a territory is, inherently, less "real" than the territory itself. It is not what it represents, and the convention, the *narrative and grammer*, of this representation is somewhat arbitrary. 

However, a more true representation of the territory, a picture, is usually less useful for navigation than the schematic representation, the map. Despite the map being less "real".

This ties into science and history, and indeed all knowledge.

One can argue-and I **will** argue and **will**, with **confidence**, state-that all knowledge is a way of relating *something* out there, in reality, to the *subjective*, the person. Reality exists. The person, the subject, is what is changed by knowledge.

This *way of relating knowledge* can never be "objective", because it is inherently trying to relate an *objective reality* to a *subjective individual*. Even the most "true" science isn't objective. It can't be. It's a way of forming *knowledge*, which requires interaction with the subject. This doesen't mean it does not correspond to reality-in some *flawed definitions* being objective-but that correspondence must go through subjective relationships, namely numbers, statistics, words, *the Grammer of knowledge*, to be relatable to a person.

To get off the philosophical tract, this is why *narrative* is so important. The facts of history exist, *out there*, in reality. But narrative is a neccessary function of relating them *to the reader* to form *knowledge about the world*, a *map of reality* that allows for *navigation*. The annal and chronicle might have "facts" about "reality", but because they don't help the reader form useful *conceptual maps*, they are a lesser form of history.

However the **assumption** is that the purpose of history is the formation of these maps. A more post-modernistic approach, devoid of an attempt to relate history to *reality as exists*, either out of disinterest or the stronger statement that reality *does not exist*, does not need this narrative to accomplish it's goals. 

Narratives are a way of relating historical knowledge to the subject, and as a grammatical convention are absolutely vital **for that purpose**. But freed of **that purpose**, they aren't neccessary. Ironically, the forms of "history" that least require objecitivty are most benefitted by questioning the assumption of narrative that robs history of "objectivity". 

This is doubly ironic becomes post-modernists typically shackle themselves *to* narrative, without a clear cause; they reject the objecitivty of history while shackling themselves to the conventions that revolve around it. Why does their message need to flow in a narrative, given that it no longer tries to convey true knowledge? Post-modernism isn't "telling it at you like", it's freedom not to "tell it" at *all*.
