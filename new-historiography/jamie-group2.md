So after reading through, I really like David's #1 idea and Zachery's ideas for layout and linkability. It's a little more streamlined version of what I sort of had in mind, almost like a Wikipedia of historiography. I feel like for ease of navigation and usability we should stick to the same basic timeline and groupings that Kelley uses. Also, for ease of us writing it. 

Someone in class Monday brought up that for each "chapter" we should have a clearly outlined introduction that sets learning expectations for each chapter and maybe proposes things for them to think about while reading - I like this idea because it simplifies what Kelley is trying to do with his endless intorductory examples. I propose we take it one step further and recap things briefly at the end of the chapter as well, almost like an essay. Then the space in between the introduction and the recap can be used for specific information, and how this chapter's content interacts with recurring themes like myth, audience, and methodologies. So essentially, it could go like this:

  * Introduction, perhaps one or two **interesting** stories that provide examples foreshadowing the upcoming chapter
  * Things you need to know about this time period
  * Themes common in this time period - myth, ideology, methods, audience, etc.
  * Criticisms
  * Recap

I am also a fan of linking any names to a pop-up box that displays a wiki entry or something, so the reader can get a quick overview of why they should care about this new person we just mentioned.

Photos are a good idea. Reading endless amounts of text without pictures can be boring, especially online.
