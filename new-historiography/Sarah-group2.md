I think that having our own website that highlights important ideas, themes, people, etc. from most of the chapters is a really fun idea. We should go through the chapters we decide to keep, and find a few (maybe 2 or 3, but no more than that) people that Kelley brings up that we feel have the most significance, as well as the main themes and ideas we have discussed in class.

I also think that something we need to keep in mind when writing our own version of this book is that we are trying to focus on the *historiography* that Kelley brings up, rather than the *historical events* (which he also brings up), to make things less confusing and more to the point.

Maybe we could figure out a way to color-code things on our website to make it easier to navigate, or even have pictures associated with each chapter to help with memory.

I believe that our **main goal** for this project should be *simplifying* the material to make it easier to comprehend right away.
