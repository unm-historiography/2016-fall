<b> Thinking About the Website. </b><br><br>
So, this is a disaster. Anyway, I spent a lot of time thinking about what a website might look like for our particular project. I have a couple of ideas.<br><br>
First, I think it’s necessary that it has aspects of both <b>chronicle</b> and a <b>narrative</b> style. I think that they should be linkable back and forth to each other. <br><br>
<b>How is this even possible?</b><br><br>
And to be fair I have no idea. But I imagine two big links in the center of the website. And for lack of better term right now one can be named “Chronicle” and the other “Narrative”. They can be big. They can be rectangles.<br><br>
Okay, so inside our big rectangles is exactly that. A chronicle version of the spiel and a narrative one. Of course they will both be generously stripped and refined from the original. <br><br><b> Stay with me here.</b><br><br>
<b><i>What if I wanted to just read about one particular person or place?</b></i><br><br>
Easy. So at the top of websites there are generally links. You know homepage or what have you. Well our links can be “era” specific. So “myth” “Greek” “Christian” and so on. They can either drop down and list a bunch of specific people… or (and I like this better) they can have their own page in which we briefly describe what each deal was about. <br>
<br><b><i>What about all of those damned names?</b></i><br><br>
Easy. Anytime we name anyone ever we can hyper link those bad boys and every name can have it’s own page that describes so and so a bit. This will make it easier to focus on meaning and not weigh the whole project down with citations or references or what have you.<br>
<br><b><i> Okay, so how do the big sections link to eachother?</b></i><br><br>
Easy. <b>Dates.</b> Click on a date in the narrative it’ll swing you over back to the chronical page, click on a date in the chronical page it’ll link your ass back to the narrative page. Easy money. <br>
<br>So this is what I got brewin’ in my head so far. I wish I had enough will power to make a sketch of my idea but I can do that later. Too tired for now. As for the aethic appeal of the website we need to assign a swag department that can focus on that too. <br><br>Goodnight,<br>
