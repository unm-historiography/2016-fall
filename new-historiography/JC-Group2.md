I would like to see the order of the site to be the same as the book. We are trying to make Faces of History a more condensed version that is easier to understand and read. Working in pairs would be a good idea because we could bounce ideas off each other and make sure we all stay on track.

Site setup
- List of topic that go in order that follows Faces.

 - Greek, Roman, Renaissance, Midieval, Christians, and Science, etc.
 
- Focus on two to three main characters in each topic.

 - Herodotus, City of Rome, Livy, etc.
 
The details like color, font, and style can all be worked out later as a group.
