During last class someone mentioned having the home page be the introduction.  I really like this idea and it sort of deals with the problem of people who skip the introduction; if the intro is the homepage then people will probably actually read it.

*Here are some things we could include in this section:*

- discussing how we will approach the topics, what time periods we are going over and some of the main themes we will be addressing throughout.
- including some of Jenkinsâ€™s discussion and ideas about history to get the reader thinking critically
- possibly some mention of the interplay of myth and history

We could then have different sections for each of the different chapters we are looking at.  At the top of the page for each of these we could have some links which would bring you directly to specific sections of that chapter or you could just scroll down and approach the chapter linearly.  For example, at the top of the page on Greek history we could have a link for Herodotus which would bring you down to that specific part of the chapter.

I also liked the idea of having hyperlinks to pages on the different historians.  We could also potentially take that idea further and include hyperlinks to online versions of our sources, if there are online versions available.  These could be included throughout the site using footnotes or something, and we could add them into some separate section for our sources as well.
