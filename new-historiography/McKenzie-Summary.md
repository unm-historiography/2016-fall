  Seeing history as a science and as an art is not something new to Kelley’s book.  Even the comparison of poetry and history is not new to us.  While most agree history came from early poetry, very few admit it’s the same thing.  Aristotle said poetry was more philosophical than history, but Lorenzo Valla argues “History is more robust than poetry because it is more truthful,” (189).  I wonder what historians or future historians’ opinions are on poetry versus history, **are they the same, similar, or completely different?**  **Can poetry be more truthful than history?**

  Although there were a lot of names and quotations in this chapter, I really liked the mashup of opinions.  This is really seen in the second paragraph on page 189.  Four scholars make up this paragraph.  Bruni writes “knowledge of the past gives guidance to our counsels and our practical judgment, and the consequences of similar undertakings [in the past] will encourage or deter us according to our circumstances in the present”.   Pomponio Leto writes “As a soul is to the body, so history is to the other inheritances…for it offers the best part of wisdom [and] an imitation of life”.  Pier Paul Verherio wrote “I accord the first place to History on the grounds both of its attractiveness and of its utility, qualities which appeal equally to the scholar and to the statesman”.  Guarino de Verona wrote “The aim of history was to gather many ages into one view”.

  One of the more important questions I had while reading this developed when I read the opposing views of Valla and Henry Cornelius Agrippa.  Valla believed history was essential to learn the **truth**.  He said “Without history one remains always a child”.  On the flip side, Henry Cornelius Agrippa said History may inspire the imitation of virtue, it does the opposite too; leading readers to admire “great and furious thieves and famous despoilers of the world,” (190).  I believe history brings knowledge of the past, but also believe some people who don’t deserve to be remembered can be adored, and a blind eye is turned to all their wrong-doings.  I see truth to both sides of this argument, and wanted to know the opinions of others.
