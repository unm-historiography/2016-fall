I think that organizing chapters in chronological order makes sense, and seems like the most logical approach.  However, the convenience of a website is that everything does not need to be read in a linear fashion.  Having an index or quick-reference links to various sections would be very useful for someone looking for information from a specific topic.  To answer Rob’s question, I do think it would be a good think to include an introduction chapter, and perhaps a conclusion as well, to tie it all together.  I also like Sarah’s idea of using a color-coding system to facilitate association with different chapters.
