The chronological association of history is strong, yet somewhat limiting. It offers the potential of a coherent narrative organization, yet at the same time this narrative can easily be lost in the noise. Yet without it, the problem of disjointed narratives becomes stronger.

As a simple brainstorm, I can foresee three ways of organizing, and their relation to chronology.

1. Simply follow chronology, one chapter each era, but focus on a single central theme or a suite of themes.
  
  a. Each time period get's a chapter. Within that chapter, we have three to four subsections detailing relevance to themes we identify.
  
  b. These themes could, for instance, be "Methodology", "Cultural Identity", and "Purpose". I name those as plausible suggestions, but this is going to the the hardest question here. We can only have a few discrete thematic elements, and they must be *strong enough to hold throughout all of history*.

    
2. Abandon chronlogy entirely. Thematic organization; deal with multiple themes and do so without clear chronological order (chronology might inevitably pop up, of course)
  
  a. Again, we need to agree on themes. These themes will need to be strong enough to warrant a chapter, but not per say as strong as holding relevance throughout all of history.
    * Examples could be "Truth", "Government-history interactions", "Cultural Identity", "Universalism", "Technology and history", "Historical Methodology", etc
  
  b. Has major potential to be massively disjointed. This would require good writing, editing, and oversight. Otherwise it sounds like babble; this is the harder narrative.
  
  c. Would lack narrative in terms of beginning and conclusion. Unless we can agree on a super-theme to start the book, and another mirroring theme which somehow links all previous themes, we have an episodic work instead of a central narrative.
  
  d. Hell to organize. Who writes what? If we agree a difficult theme is central, but hard to write, who draws short shift?
  
  
 3. Organize with themes, then chronology. 
  
  a. As in 2, we organize by themes, but as in 1 they are major ones. We have two or three "Acts" of the book, and then multiple "Chapters" in each act for the time periods, with an introduction and conclusion.
  
  b. Mostly same as 1, but places more emphasis on themes than time period. 
  
  c. Might be longer, and more work. Is easier to organize than 2 but harder than 1.
  
  d. Some degree of narrative conclusion is lacking. Might be mildly redundent, and probably willl be in that different sections with mention different authors, but that's not always bad.
   
And regardless, we need to agree on one or more themes; that's what we're trying to fix. Even if we can't all *agree on a conclusion*, we must be having the same *discussion*.

Another issue we have to address is "What time periods?", if we do use chronlogy to frame our writing. Kelley made certain divisions of time-do we honor that? Modify it slightly? The question does not apply if we jump off the mountain entirely, of course, and don't bother with time periods.
