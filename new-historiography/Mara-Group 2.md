**Utilization of the Website**

Okay so I am on board with using a website rather than a book, but I am considered about the **practical** use of a website. 
Personally I need to highlight and write to retain information I read.  If my professor sent me to a website to read what 
seems to be a pretty important text in the course, I would need to download a **pdf version or something** that may allow me 
to add highlights.  I have literally no idea how we could make this happen, but I think there needs to be some venue people 
could *utilize* that would allow them to **highlight** the work on the site.  

**Content**

I think we all need to keep in mind that we are trying to make a **better** version of Faces, so let’s not get too 
**complicated**. I don’t think we should get **hyperlink happy** because let’s be honest how many people would really use 
those.  I think we need to make sure the important background information is in the chapter and then hyperlinks should be used largely
for people.  I know we talked about this, but I think it is really important to include a kind of myth history chapter or 
something as a **introduction** so we send people into the book a **little skeptical**. 

This is sorta all I’ve got for now.  I think our **next step** needs to be to decide our main topics, themes, historians, etc.
