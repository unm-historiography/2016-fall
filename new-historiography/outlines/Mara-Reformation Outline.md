**Reformation Chapter** (definitely need a better title but I am not creative enough for that)

1. **pre-Reformation** 
   1. duality of government and the church 
   2. **conflicting** histories both trying to claim authority 
     * one secular, one religious
     * hierarchy foundation of both
     * lack in education/literacy 
   3. “two swords” analogy p.163
      * I think its a great way to visualize the world pre-Reformation
2. **Reformation** 
   1. brief account of events
     * basically give the how and why for the Reformation
       * **“every man a priest”**
          * related to no hierarchy 
          * encouraged education/literacy 
          * undermined where knowledge came from i.e. the church 
        * no hierarchy 
        * required literacy 
        * mainly a religious movement but the jump from no hierarchy in church to no hierarchy in government is quite small
       * came from a deep distrust of the Catholic church
         * again questioned where knowledge and authority came from
     * Martin Luther
        * I think a hyperlink for him would be great
        * in the chapter itself we don’t need much just enough to understand major points
   2. effects
     * **undermined hierarchy** that was quintessential during the time
     * questioned tradition 
     * became grounds for criticism 
       * essentially people who just follow tradition must be question maybe even thrown out, Dante p.164 
     * attempted to change the long standing narrative that centered around Catholicism 
     * sparked criticism of prior work
        * was a little different then before
        * large quantity of work
        * almost as if the work before the Reformation was tainted 
3. **Johann Sleidan**
   1. good example of Reformation history 
   2. without more knowledge about him the information in the current book seems adequate 
     * history of career
     * historical ideology 
       * rather die than lie kind of stuff p.169
   3. deals briefly with truth I think this could be expanded in our version as truth in this time period was a central theme
     * finding a “true religion”
     * where does truth come from?
     * who is a valid/reliable source of truth?
4. **Origins** 
   1. Protestants had to **construct** their origins 
   2. establish Protestantism as the true religion
   3. **undermine** Catholicism 
   4. brings into question what is truth as stated truth is central here because a “new” religion is trying to establish their
   truth and refute another’s truth 
   5. question the validity of pervious origins, sorta made them into myths
     * “None of these later sixteenth century historians accepted the royalist myths of Trojan origins and alleged Carolingian         creations, but new mythical constructs had arisen to replace the old ones.” (pg. 179)
     * another way to undermine the longstanding history 
5. **National Histoires**
  1. I looked over the work for the chapter in github and almost no one said anything about the national histories and in 
  fact I don’t remember talking about them much in class
  2. **maybe these aren’t important to us?**
  3. **or maybe they belong in another chapter?**
  4. In a sense they fit here because the Reformation caused the Protestant to create a sort of national history, but at 
  the same time the jump form religion to secular state histories seems sorta strange 
  5. essentially at this point I am not sure where this part of Kelley’s chapter fits in for us, but I do think it is 
  important to talk about how nations began to create national histories in the same as Rome
