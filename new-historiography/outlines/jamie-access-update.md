Access to history and historiography is a broader theme in Kelley's text. Humans exhibit a natural inclination to know things, but access (or lack thereof) colors perspective and affects the perception of truth.

#**Access to history in Greek/Roman times**

The various methods used in creating Greek and Roman history are central to the development of Western thought and ideals. This section will outline the factors that influenced both the creators and consumers of history during Roman times, how that has impacted later historians and historiographers, and how that has influenced the broader narrative of history to date.
  * Who made history in Greek/Roman times? Why is this important?
   * Herotodus
   * Thucidydes
  * Literacy - most in Roman society can at least read. Who is reading history?
  * How much of history is for individuals? 
  * Rhetoric - how does knowledge of rhetoric affect ability to read, write, and understand history?

#**Access to history in Christian and Medieval times**

In the Christian and Medieval periods, we see the narrative arc of history change from one focused on truthiness to one that begins to build a construct for Christian thought and values. This time period sees the introduction of chronicles as a new method to achieve "truth" in history, as well as an emerging national narrative among the Germanic tribes, making history accessible to even the "barbarians".
  * The Dark Ages
   * destruction of existing and cessation of new documents
  * Literacy - changing from general literacy in Roman times to limited literacy in the Dark Ages, now only available to elite.
  * Christianity and it's impact on history/historiography
   * Libraries become part of the church 
   * Most historical documents are written to promote and lend credence to Christian views

#**Access to history in the Renaissance**

During the Renaissance, thinkers begin to challenge the narrative of history and openly criticize the works of their predecessors. This leads to a surge in nationalism in history and historiography, leaving historians free to postulate on how the events of the past have shaped the present and how they will shape the future.
  * Criticism
   * Petrarch
   * Machiavelli
   * Valla
  * Nationalism
   * How does nationalistic pride affect the creation and perception of history?
  * Patronage - who wants this history made?
  * Colonialism
  * The printing press
   * Bulk dissemination of ideas
   * Literacy - who can read these ideas?


#**Access to history in the Enlightenment**
  * Changing audience of history
  * Again, changing literacy
  * History becoming more scientific, more philosphical, how does this impact audience/access?
