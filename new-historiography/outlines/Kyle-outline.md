***Truth***(Historical Criticism) 
- **Greeks**: 
 - **Primary vs. Secondary sources**
   1. "For Herodotus, history depended on one of two criteria, that is be based on testimony that was either eyewitness (opsis) or hearsay (akoe)"(Pg21)
    2. "Thucydides distrusted hearsay evidence and relied either on eyewitness testimony or on "what others saw for me"."(Pg29)
 - **Mythical foundations of the world**
   1. "The historian (Herodotus)... using myth and heroic deeds in his stories, though in a mode that is critical, analytical, and somewhat ironic."(Pg20)
 - **Became critical of personal accounts**
   1. "Later he (Herodotus) generalized this disclaimer: "For myself, my duty is to report all that I have said, but I am not obliged to believe it all alike-a remark which may be understood to apply to my whole History."(Pg23)
 - **Started to look for "truth" within the sources**
   1. "Being a good historian,however,involved more than just being a good man or a good citizen, for it required that he be prepared to tell the truth at all costs, to the extent of accusing a friend or praising an enemy" (Pg33) 
    2. "they(historians) should stick to facts that can be verified according to standards established long before by Herodotus and Thucydides." (Pg33) 
    3. "Deprived of truth, Polybius aphorized, employing the usual optical metaphor, history is like a man deprived of eyesight"(Pg33)
 - **Beginning of political history**
   1. "Thucydides preferred to attend to the political and military aspects of Athenian imperialism"(Pg29)
    2. "Thucydides' special concern was the question of economic motivation and power" (Pg29)
    3. "Thucydides' history-that "historical writing had not become political, but political thinking had become historical."(Pg30)
 - **Impartiality**
   1. "The task of the historian, according to Lucian, is to tell what happened and not to spend time in useless praise"(Pg47)
    2. "the historian, out of respect for the facts, must follow it and worship only Truth."(Pg47)
    3. "the historian's sole task is to tell the tale as it happened"(Pg47) 

- **Romans**: Truth was required but secondary to rhetoric, In Livy there is still a strong current of legends and myth in Roman times, Tacitus began to tell no stories for wonder but to tell only what he heard and what his fathers had written down, 
- **Christians**:Truth is secondary to literary ambitions, The higher spiritual meaning was looked for, "Truth" was found in the Bible as the word and law of God (81), Concerned with creating myths of Origin to the original church, became more critical of sources used. 
- **Medieval**:Origin myths of the barbarian nations of Europe to the ancient world, A distinction between the chronicles and histories emerged, A battle between secular truth and christian belief, Some myth histories being called fiction, Factual truth found in chronicles and meaningful truth found in Histories, scholars become more critical of one anothers sources.
- **Renaissance/Reformation**: Truth was finding a tie to the first church and its traditions, History becomes more academic and needed by kingdoms/cities, Truth was still subordinate to Christian tradition but it was between multiple tradtions battling one another, Source criticism was a major force during this time with multiple churches battling for dominance. 
- **Enlightenment**: History became a formal discipline with a methodology for gaining truth and remaining impartial, Codification of history, Truth and impartiality became central to history, became more secular and involved critically understanding your sources, Historical criticism began to tear apart myth histories of nations, The formal scholarship of historians began with the republic of letters.
