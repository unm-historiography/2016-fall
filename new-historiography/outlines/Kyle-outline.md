***Truth***(Historical Criticism) 
- **Greeks**: 
 - **Primary vs. Secondary sources**
   1. "For Herodotus, history depended on one of two criteria, that is be based on testimony that was either eyewitness (opsis) or hearsay (akoe)"(Pg21)
    2. "Thucydides distrusted hearsay evidence and relied either on eyewitness testimony or on "what others saw for me"."(Pg29)
 - **Mythical foundations of the world**
   1. "The historian (Herodotus)... using myth and heroic deeds in his stories, though in a mode that is critical, analytical, and somewhat ironic."(Pg20)
 - **Became critical of personal accounts**
   1. "Later he (Herodotus) generalized this disclaimer: "For myself, my duty is to report all that I have said, but I am not obliged to believe it all alike-a remark which may be understood to apply to my whole History."(Pg23)
 - **Started to look for "truth" within the sources**
   1. "Being a good historian,however,involved more than just being a good man or a good citizen, for it required that he be prepared to tell the truth at all costs, to the extent of accusing a friend or praising an enemy" (Pg33) 
    2. "they(historians) should stick to facts that can be verified according to standards established long before by Herodotus and Thucydides." (Pg33) 
    3. "Deprived of truth, Polybius aphorized, employing the usual optical metaphor, history is like a man deprived of eyesight"(Pg33)
 - **Beginning of political history**
   1. "Thucydides preferred to attend to the political and military aspects of Athenian imperialism"(Pg29)
    2. "Thucydides' special concern was the question of economic motivation and power" (Pg29)
    3. "Thucydides' history-that "historical writing had not become political, but political thinking had become historical."(Pg30)
 - **Impartiality**
   1. "The task of the historian, according to Lucian, is to tell what happened and not to spend time in useless praise"(Pg47)
    2. "the historian, out of respect for the facts, must follow it and worship only Truth."(Pg47)
    3. "the historian's sole task is to tell the tale as it happened"(Pg47) 
- **Romans**: 
 - Truth was required but secondary to rhetoric, 
 - In Livy there is still a strong current of legends and myth in Roman times, 
 - Tacitus began to tell no stories for wonder but to tell only what he heard and what his fathers had written down, 
- **Christians**:
 - Truth is secondary to literary ambitions, 
 - The higher spiritual meaning was looked for, 
 - "Truth" was found in the Bible as the word and law of God (81), 
 - Concerned with creating myths of Origin to the original church, 
 - became more critical of sources used. 
- **Medieval**:
 - **Beginnings of Secular history:Origin myths of the barbarian nations of Europe**
    1. "Paralleling the imperial tradition was that of the Roman pontiffs, who claimed an even grander heritage, their apostolic succession leading back not merely to falsely divinized pagan rulers but to St.Peter himself"(Pg117)
    2. "the ancient Roman *imperators* being the ancestors of the elected Hohenstaufen emperors" (Pg117)
 - **A distinction between the chronicles and histories emerged**
    1. "A distinction was made in the medievel period between an author and mere copyists or compilers" (Pg 103)
    2. "The chronicler has no such purpose but merely followed the random events of the Years of our Lord" (Pg 120)
    3. "It belongs to the historian to strive for truth, to charm his hearers or readers by his sweet and elegant language, to inform them of the true facts about the actions, character and life of the hero whom he is describing, and to include nothing else but what seems in reason to be appropriate to history." (Pg120) 
 - **A battle between secular truth and christian belief**
   1. 
 - **Some myth histories being called fiction**
   1. "*History of the Kings of Britain*, which reintroduced a poetic and mythological element into national historiography in the form of the Trojan and Arthurian legends and which was **denounced** by conventional historians for its *violations* of the **cannons of historical truth**
    2. "Geoffrey's work provoked reactions from more literal-minded authors such as William of Newburgh, who assailed "the laughable work of fiction" which Geoffrey wove about the ancient Britons." (Pg123)
 - **Factual truth found in chronicles and meaningful truth found in Histories**
   1. 
 - **scholars become more critical of one anothers sources**
   1. "Christian truth did occasionally require historical criticism, especially in an age of growing literacy, and orthodox chroniclers drew the line at poetic invention" (Pg123)
- **Renaissance & Reformation**: 
 - Truth was finding a tie to the first church and its traditions, 
 - History becomes more academic and needed by kingdoms/cities, 
 - Truth was still subordinate to Christian tradition but it was between multiple tradtions battling one another,
 - Source criticism was a major force during this time with multiple churches battling for dominance. 
- **Enlightenment**: 
 - **History became a formal discipline with a methodology for gaining truth and remaining impartial**
   1. "As history... was also attaining scientific status...history became, literally and conceptually, a science because it was organized according to a systematic method, oreinted toward universals rather than particulars, and so raised above arts"(Pg193) 
    2. "Partisanship, whether paid or not, was a basic fault; and as a remedy Bodin recommended consulting rival authors"(Pg199) 
    3. "Scholars clinging to the humanist tradition hoped to salvage traditional learning, arguing that it was important to study error as well as truth in order to attain an understanding of the human condition."(Pg205) 
    4. "In the seventeenth century the art of uncovering forgeries became an essential part of historical criticism-culminating in the hypercriticism of the nineteenth-century scholars."(Pg207)
 - **Codification of history, Truth and impartiality became central to history**
   1. "Bodin's major goal was what may be regarded as the *codification of history*, beginning with a comprehensive, classified list of histories, and the proper order of reading them, and with the methodical structuring of the knowledge produced by such reading"(Pg199)
    2. "this was a task for a historian, since it was essential to attend *not only what is said, but also by whom it is said, with what words it is said, in what time, on what occassion, what precedes, and what follows*." 
 - **History became more secular and involved critically understanding your sources**
   1. "history continued to be appreciated for what passed for scientific reasons, especially since history, no less than natural philosophy, had a method"(Pg205) 
    2. "For Bayle, the proper method was fundamentally that of the humanist call for the rejection of tradition in favor of a return to the "sources rather than streams"(Pg 207)
 - **Historical criticism began to tear apart myth histories of nations**
   1. "sixteenth century historical criticism was already at work eliminating myths of origins"(Pg202)
 - **The formal scholarship of historians began with the republic of letters**
   1. "Of course history possessed very different meanings in the critical and crisis-ridden eighteenth century, according to various national "prejudices", with Italian,French,British,and German scholars interpreting it according to **different tastes and traditions**" (Pg 219) 
    2. "Beyond national allegiances and religious divisions, the wider world of historical scholarship was defined by **the republic of letters**, in which information and ideas were exchanged, circles, societies, and academies were formed, libraries were opened to researchers, bibliographies and encyclopedias were published, and scholars broadened their horizons directly by more or less institutionalized international voyages, the *itinera italicum, gallicum,* and *germanicum*." (Pg219)
