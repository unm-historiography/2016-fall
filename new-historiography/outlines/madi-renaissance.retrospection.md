During the Renaissance the focus of historiography moved from religious to secular, although religion still played a role, it was not as central to the focus of historical writing.  New themes became more prevalent in the writing of history such as law, politics, and a growing focus on the origins of city-states (perhaps a precursor to national histories).

**Main Ideas & Themes of the Chapter**
- The rise of city-states and the chronicles associated with them
  - mythical foundation of these city states which sought to tie themselves directly to Roman antiquity. Another take on origins. (pg. 136).
- History still often viewed as a way of learning from the mistakes/successes of the past
  - Petrarch’s *“fascination with the ancients was associated with his quest for models to imitate.” (pg. 134).
  - Compagni *“meant to teach his fellow citizens the penalties of ‘arrogance, wickedness, and struggles for office’ and the civil strife produced by these vices.”* (pg. 138).
  - Machiavelli *”properly understood, it was the key to successful statecraft and warfare for a ruler and his counsellors.” (pg. 146).
- 14th C change in view of history, *“shifted emphasis from the chams of a ‘life of solitude’ to the demands of civic commitment, and their view of history shifted accordingly.”* (pg. 138)
- furthered development of source criticism as demonstrated by both Petrarch (pg 133) and Valla (pg 140).  Source criticism proving historical documents to be forgeries.
- political and military history in the Thucydidean approach characterised this time (pg 142).
- understanding history important for modern politics, Seyssel & Machiavelli, (pg 144). 
- Latin authors of antiquity were more popular among European readers than Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, and others. (pg 147). 
- Although Latin authors were more popular, the Thucydidean way of writing history was dominant, especially in France and Italy during the Renaissance.  *“Thucydides suited the tastes of devotees of both the new politics in the sixteenth century and the new science in the seventeenth, as he would the tastes of many modern professional historians.”* (pg 152).
- influence of the printing press.  Could bring a ‘wealth of information’ together into one text, and expose readers to the works of foreign cultures. (pg 153).
- belief in advancement/progress in history. (pg 160).

**Origins**
- Chroniclers often included mythical foundation of city states which linked them with Roman antiquity.(pg. 136).
- Bruni *“He broke with precedent by focusing on the ‘known history of the city’ and rejecting the fables of Trojan foundations, the destruction by Totila, and subsequent Carolingian refoundation.”* (pg 139).  Movement away from the traditional view which linked city-states with the mythical past of antiquity. 
- Machiavelli approached origins in terms of economic development (pg 149).

**Petrarch**
- a humanist scholar, believed that the medieval view of history was lamentable and that there would eventually be a revival of historical study.  *“Genius, virtue, and glory now have gone, leaving chance and sloth to rule … once there was, and yet will be, a more fortunate age.”* (pg 130/131).
- wrote *Africa* which was a “nostalgic celebration of antiquity and vision of posterity.”* (pg 131).
- *“took both origins, and goals, both a remote antiquity and and an idealised future, into his conception of history.”* (pg 131).
- prejudice against the barbarism of the recent past, and disheartened concerning the barbarian infiltration into Italy.
- wrote a *“pioneering piece of historical criticism.”*  Demonstrated that a grant, supposedly written by Caesar, which exempted Austria from imperial jurisdiction was a forgery. (pg 133).
- like earlier historians, his view of history was still linked to his religious views (ex. Rome as both head of the world and City of God.) (pg 133).

**Giovanni Villani**
- one of the earlier of the city-state chroniclers.  Villani was from Florence & wrote in the vernacular, was eventually killed by the plague.
- this chronicle was a *“comprehensive survey of the story of Florence from mythical foundation to the crisis of his own day, in which financial ruin was capped by the appearance of the plague.”* (pg. 137)
- *“he regularly noted the effects of natural disasters, but he also attended to the commercial and cultural progress of the Florentine people, as illustrated by architectural triumphs, the coinage of the florin, and the career of his contemporary Dante.”* (pg. 138).
 - a report of 'facts' in the traditional sense of the chronicle, *writing what happened*, and a report of the development of culture as well.  Expansion of what is considered historically significant.

**French Historiography**
- Chastellain *“he also took pride in his historiographical calling, which was honored with an official appointment in 1455.”* (pg 142).
 - May mark a transition where writing history is becoming more of a profession than previously.
- a focus on political life in France
- de Commynes, linked with Thucydides, *“offering not only realistic politico-military narrative but also advice for princely consumption.”* (pg. 143).  Again, the purpose of history to teach (in this case princes).
- saw a ‘divine balance’ in the power struggles of opposing nations which *”princes and other powerful men could maneuver but which they could never fully master.”* (pg 142). 
- discusses the importance of princes accepting good counsel ‘from men link himself’ to ensure political success. (pg 143).
- Seyssel had political experience and civil law degree. (More of the Thucydides approach). History permitted analysis of political change (pg 144).
- contributions to tradition of national history
- use of the vernacular to write history, an attempt to elevate the French language, and therefore the French nation to the level of the Greeks & Romans. (pg 146).

**Machiavelli**
- Machiavelli was took to writing historiography in an enforced retirement after his political failure. 
- study of history was the key to political science and to making rational and prudent policy. (pg 147). 
- *“sought answers to questions about human nature, class structure, political faction, the role of religion, republican liberty, and the sources of political power.” (pg. 147)
- worked with large patterns of change, e.g. translation of empire, cyclical conception of Polybius.
- History of Rome offered examples to imitate, Florence offered examples to avoid (pg. 149).  Roman antiquity still the idea to strive for. 
- *“in his survey of the Florentine past Machiavelli relied on both chronicle and humanist traditions - Villani and Bruni - but subjected the record to strong interpretations in the light of his political premises and purposes.”* (pg. 149). 
- Wrote *Florentine Histories* in which he describes origins. *“For Machiavelli the origins of Florence were to be sought not in the deeds of legendary heroes but in economic convenience and the founding of markets.” (pg 149).  Also drew large political lessons from his narrative.

**Guicciardini**
- Interest in the invasion of 1494 as a turning point for political history.  *“It was this transformation that inspired Guicciardini, Machiavelli, and other to ask fundamental questions about political change and to produce what J. H. Hexter called the ‘vision of politics on the eve of the Reformation.’”* (pg. 151).
- analysed in detail, sometimes using archival sources, *”diplomatic preparations, deceptions, and maneuvering underlying the French Invasion.”* (pg 151).  Took into account the character of major individuals involved, movement towards concentration on the actions of the individual within the historical narrative.

**Cultural History**
- many authors began to look at cultural history in the Herodotean sense, eventually including ‘the arts and sciences of humanist learning’ as a part of history. (pg 152).
- history grew to include things from *“letters to laws, from myth to philosophy and religion, from tribal organization to the state, from agriculture to modern science, from technology to commerce.”* (pg 152). History as a way of organizing and understanding human culture.
- expansion of the historical study of law.
- expansion of which cultures were studied in the historiographical canon, *“modern scholars began to investigate a whole sequence of barbarian cultures, including not only the Jews but also Babylonians, Indians, Persians, Egyptians, Celts, and later Chinese and Amerindians.” (pg 154).
- holy people of every culture were in pursuit of ‘true wisdom’ and modern scholars had to *“trace the development of this wisdom … from its mythical beginning through a ‘succession of doctrine’ to its fulfillment in Christian philosophy.”* (pg 154).
- *“reason was also present in modern vernacular languages and that the Moderns had to follow their own lines of inquiry and thought.”* (pg 156).  A shift in the traditional view that antiquity was the idea, now we begin to see an appreciation for modern society and intellectualism.

**Impact of the Discovery of the New World on Historiography**
- disrupted the classic view of history, *“the old story of the three continents, four monarchies, and six ages of the world.”* (pg 156).
- told the story of the new world with ‘old categories and methods.’  *“with the help of classical style and precedent .. told the story as a continuation of the European drive for empire.”* (pg 157).
- Spanish historical writing at the time *“was a mixture of the old and the new - medieval chronicles and universal histories competing with humanist narratives, historical criticism with entrenched myths, the new art of printing easily accommodating both.”* (pg 157).
 - This is the environment in which historians attempted to tackle the New World and how it fit into history.
- *“the idea of imperial dominion was radically redefined, and it acted powerfully to reshape interpretations of Spanish, European, and universal history.”* (pg 158).
- expanded old universal history, *“conventional ‘theatre’ of human history was enlarged beyond recognition by the outpourings of sixteenth-century travel literature.”* (pg 159).


If we were to approach this more thematically and then have an example of a historian who fits under that theme this chapter could potentially be organized like this:
- humanism
 - Petrarch
- city-state chroniclers
 - Villani
- political/legal history
 - Machiavelli
 - Guicciardini
 - some stuff on French historiography (de Commynes maybe)
- Cultural history
 - Vergil
- The New World
 - I don't know who would go here or if we would really need a person.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in this section who stands out, although there are a lot of names that we could look into further.
