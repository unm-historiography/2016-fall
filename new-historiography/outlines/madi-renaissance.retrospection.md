## Renaissance Historiography
During the Renaissance the focus of historiography moved from religious to secular, although religion still played a role, it was not as central to the focus of historical writing.  New themes became more prevalent in the writing of history such as law, politics, and a growing focus on the origins of city-states (perhaps a precursor to national histories).  The topics that were considered to be historically significant also expanded during this time.

**Humanism**
- a movement towards tangible human elements of history rather than the focus on the divine that we’ve seen up to this point.
- **Petrarch**
 - a humanist scholar, believed that the medieval view of history was lamentable and that there would eventually be a revival of historical study.  *“Genius, virtue, and glory now have gone, leaving chance and sloth to rule … once there was, and yet will be, a more fortunate age.”* (pg 130/131).
 - wrote *Africa* which was a “nostalgic celebration of antiquity and vision of posterity.”* (pg 131).
 - *“took both origins, and goals, both a remote antiquity and and an idealised future, into his conception of history.”* (pg 131).
 - prejudice against the barbarism of the recent past, and disheartened concerning the barbarian infiltration into Italy.
 - wrote a *“pioneering piece of historical criticism.”*  Demonstrated that a grant, supposedly written by Caesar, which exempted Austria from imperial jurisdiction was a forgery. (pg 133).
   - development of critical approach to history
 - like earlier historians, his view of history was still linked to his religious views (ex. Rome as both head of the world and City of God.) (pg 133).

**City-State Chronicles**
- “There are countless chronicles, repetitive and overlapping, most of them still in manuscript, reflecting the emergence of a new, or renewed, civic spirit and the need of cities to preserve records for commercial and administrative as well as political and ideological purposes.” (pg 136).
- Many of these chronicles went back to their mythical origins, and through these origins they sought to tie themselves to Roman antiquity.
- **Giovanni Villani**
 - one of the earlier of the city-state chroniclers.  Villani was from Florence & wrote in the vernacular, was eventually killed by the plague leaving his brother to finish his chronicle.
 - this chronicle was a *“comprehensive survey of the story of Florence from mythical foundation to the crisis of his own day, in which financial ruin was capped by the appearance of the plague.”* (pg. 137)
 - *“he regularly noted the effects of natural disasters, but he also attended to the commercial and cultural progress of the Florentine people, as illustrated by architectural triumphs, the coinage of the florin, and the career of his contemporary Dante.”* (pg. 138).
   - a report of 'facts' in the traditional sense of the chronicle, *writing what happened*, and a report of the development of culture as well.  Expansion of what is considered historically significant.
 - When writing about contemporary events he took a more humanistic approach to history, focusing on what could be explained by human action.

**Political and Legal History**
- Much of historical writing began to focus (continuing in the humanist thread) on the study of political and military history, and how it could be applied to contemporary policy and action.
- Historians writing with the focus of politics sometimes received official appointments.
 - Chastellain *“he also took pride in his historiographical calling, which was honored with an official appointment in 1455.”* (pg 142).
   - History becoming more of a profession
- **Machiavelli**
 - Machiavelli took to writing historiography in an enforced retirement after his political failure. 
 - believed that study of history was the key to political science and to making rational and prudent policy. (pg 147). 
   - All other subjects of study were enhanced by history, so politics should be no different.
 - *“sought answers to questions about human nature, class structure, political faction, the role of religion, republican liberty, and the sources of political power.” (pg. 147)
   - Humanist approach
 - worked with large patterns of change, e.g. translation of empire, cyclical conception of Polybius.
 - History of Rome offered examples to imitate, Florence offered examples to avoid (pg. 149).  At this point, Roman antiquity is still the ideal to strive towards. 
 - *“in his survey of the Florentine past Machiavelli relied on both chronicle and humanist traditions - Villani and Bruni - but subjected the record to strong interpretations in the light of his political premises and purposes.”* (pg. 149). 
 - Wrote *Florentine Histories* in which he describes origins. *“For Machiavelli the origins of Florence were to be sought not in the deeds of legendary heroes but in economic convenience and the founding of markets.”* (pg 149).  Also drew large political lessons from his narrative.
- **Guicciardini**
 - Interest in the invasion of 1494 as a turning point for political history.  *“It was this transformation that inspired Guicciardini, Machiavelli, and other to ask fundamental questions about political change and to produce what J. H. Hexter called the ‘vision of politics on the eve of the Reformation.’”* (pg. 151).
 - analysed in detail, sometimes using archival sources, *”diplomatic preparations, deceptions, and maneuvering underlying the French Invasion.”* (pg 151).  Took into account the character of major individuals involved
   - movement towards concentration on the actions of the individual within the historical narrative.
- **de Commynes**
 - linked with Thucydides, *“offering not only realistic politico-military narrative but also advice for princely consumption.”* (pg. 143).  
   - The purpose of history has often been to teach, throughout the Renaissance history was often studied to teach political lessons.
- saw a ‘divine balance’ in the power struggles of opposing nations which *”princes and other powerful men could maneuver but which they could never fully master.”* (pg 142). 
- discusses the importance of princes accepting good counsel ‘from men link himself’ to ensure political success. (pg 143).

**Cultural History**
- Although many scholars focused on political history in the thread of Thucydides, there were other who worked with cultural history.
 - cultural history came to include ‘the arts and sciences of humanist learning’ as a part of history. (pg 152).
   - an expansion of what is considered history
- expansion of which cultures were studied in the historiographical canon, *“modern scholars began to investigate a whole sequence of barbarian cultures, including not only the Jews but also Babylonians, Indians, Persians, Egyptians, Celts, and later Chinese and Amerindians.” (pg 154).
- *“reason was also present in modern vernacular languages and that the Moderns had to follow their own lines of inquiry and thought.”* (pg 156).  
 - A shift in the traditional view that antiquity was the ideal, now we begin to see an appreciation for modern society and intellectualism.
- **Vergil**
 - for Vergil, history included things from *“letters to laws, from myth to philosophy and religion, from tribal organization to the state, from agriculture to modern science, from technology to commerce.”* (pg 152). History as a way of organizing and understanding human culture.
   - expansion of the historical study of law.

**The New World**
- disrupted the classic view of history, *“the old story of the three continents, four monarchies, and six ages of the world.”* (pg 156).
- told the story of the new world with ‘old categories and methods.’  *“with the help of classical style and precedent .. told the story as a continuation of the European drive for empire.”* (pg 157).
- Spanish historical writing at the time *“was a mixture of the old and the new - medieval chronicles and universal histories competing with humanist narratives, historical criticism with entrenched myths, the new art of printing easily accommodating both.”* (pg 157).
 - This is the environment in which historians attempted to tackle the New World and how it fit into history.
- *“the idea of imperial dominion was radically redefined, and it acted powerfully to reshape interpretations of Spanish, European, and universal history.”* (pg 158).
- expanded old universal history, *“conventional ‘theatre’ of human history was enlarged beyond recognition by the outpourings of sixteenth-century travel literature.”* (pg 159).
