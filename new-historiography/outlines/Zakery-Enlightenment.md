<b>Let’s talk about the Enlightenment</b><br><br>

Alright, so the Enlightenment was one of those crazy times right? We could basically start history from the Enlightenment. Because this is when people <i>actually</I> started thinking for themselves. Instead of being influenced by all the nonsense. But really they were just influencing each other. But, I’ll dodge the rabbit hole, for now. <br><br>

<b>People</b><br><br>
<i>Condorcet</i> <- (say that ten times… yikes!)<br>
This guy “took a Lockean view” which basically means “progress through sense experience” (217).<br>

<i>Lessing</i><br>
This guy “identified [history] with revelation” (217).<br>

<i>Ferguson</i><br>
This guy “thought in terms of social revolution” (217).<br>

<i>Cassirer</i><br>
Of course, this guy wasn’t mentioned in the beginning. But we read a great deal about him. Tossing him down as the guy who “continuing potency of the humanist tradition” (221). I feel like most our guys are like this. Maybe I’m wrong. He seems special. <br>

<i>Vico</I><br>
This dude is nuts. He wrote something called the New Science and it was basically a new encyclopedia. “The quest of a full historical meaning” – yah right – sounds like something we are trying to do (223). This guy is all about the universal history. Which is awesome. Because it’s what we are used to know – we as scholars of history are trying to synthesize all this garbage and make it beautiful. We realize it all has meaning, at least to someone or some people in time. And this is what makes it important. So we write it down and we talk about it. You read it now. If you made it this far into my dialogue at least. Anyway, this is the point. We are trying to understand the significance of things. If any. If any real significance exists. Because in doing so we can help come to terms with whatever the hell we find so significant. If we have time that is. We might die just trying to decide what the hell these dudes were trying to do. I think there is a secret here that we are missing. Maybe they were all apart of some greater joke. Way to go. Seems fine. Sorry, let’s continue…<br>

<i>Gibbon</I><br>
Care about Rome? Check this guy out (228). But really “his mission was to erudition and literature” (to basically make sense of things) (228). This dude was another universal historian. Coincidence? I think not.<br>


<i>Baile and Voltair</i><br>
They believed that history was a series of crimes (221). I would have to agree. Voltair is a good guy. I think his prose is really exciting for the time. I think using literature to exploit the greater concerns of society, history, history, people, and history is a good way to get it exposed to the public. Sort of streamline the way people consume history, and also makes it’s relatable and fun. But of course it’s fiction… so how much is history? Oops.<br>

<i> Herder </i><br>
This dude is my favorite. And I’m glad he ends the chapter… kind of (kind of ends the chapter that is). “The history of man is ultimately a theatre of transformations, which he alone can review, who animates all these figures, and feels and enjoys in them all” (248-249). So, basically it’s just a big shit show. But we love it. We love it so much – here we are talking about it all day. Seems fine. <br><br>

<b>Ideas</b><br><br>
The Enlightenment seems to just group all of the guys together. And places the broad label over all of the histories that we have argued about in class as “the education of the human race” (217). I don’t hate this. I can get on board with this. Let’s keep moving. <br><br>

<I><b>In spite of all of the differing psychological approaches to history, Ferguson wrote, “the history of the individual is but a detail of the sentiments and the thoughts he has entertained in the view of his species." </b></i><br>
What does this even mean? Well, I think this is basically what we have been arguing all semester. It’s all a contextual mess. Quite literally. So what’s the point? Well I think that’s what these guys are sort of getting at, one way or another. I think the <i>meaning</i> of the thing is what matters. That thing being history. It’s a necessary angst to fill.<br><br>
“History remained in the shadows of the Enlightenment” (218).<br><br>
“History remained philosophy teaching by example” (219). This reminds me of how people used to teach the Bible. As a history (well it is) but they made it an example for all the things. Literally all the things. I think the Enlightenment does this with everything. It doesn’t discriminate. Romans, Barbarians, heathens, historians. We got em. We got em all <br><br>
Okay so the guy goes and explains how everyone feels about everything (because obviously no one can agree on anything if we’ve learned anything during this course) – I’m not going to because it’s all in the middle of 219, but I think it is important to toss these in the spiel with our deals. <br><br>
How is Newton not more in this chapter?<br><br>

<I><b>The Human Spirit</i></b><br>
“Whose purpose was not merely to chronicle the word and deeds of men but also to reconstruct the ‘history of the human spirit/mind’” (239). I mean… if we don’t get the point by now we never will. MEANING. History needs more than a list to mean something. And meaning needs the list to make it “true” <-Yikes.<br><Br>

<I><b>I promise I’m not the worst.</i></b>

<b> Texts </b><br>
I see the Encyclopedia coming up a lot. Didrot and Alembert. I remember the dictionary that Johnson wrote, which is basically an Encyclopedia in its own right. But I don’t think he shows up in this chapter. Anyway, I’m sure the Encyclopedia has been around before the Enlightenment. <br><br>
I want you all to know that I love you very much, for making it to the end of my words.
