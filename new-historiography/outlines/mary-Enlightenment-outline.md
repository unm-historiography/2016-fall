#Introduction
-The enlightenment was a time of profound change in intellectual thought in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Thirty Years’ War, new scientific discoveries and the American and French Revolutions contributed to a change in the discourse of philosophers and historians.  
-The ideas of the Enlightenment changed the way that history was approached. The age of reason and logic was seen by some as the culmination and pinnacle of human development with earlier ages represented as infancy and adolescence of the human race. 
•	Kelley says “"History remained philosophy teaching by example” (219) This conveys the ability of history to explain about human nature, reason and virtue through actual events, it was able to answer questions in a way that philosophy alone could not.
#Key Terms
•	Due to the radical shift in perspective and new ideas that emerged during the Enlightenment some definitions of terms are required
•	Reason, in the context of the Enlightenment, is the ability to use facts, methods and logic to gain knowledge about the world. It becomes more important in academic pursuits than imagination, passion and faith. Reason comes to play a larger role in the study of history. "Reasoned history" which sought underlying causes. Why things happened became as much of an academic pursuit as what happened. 
•	Humanism is the belief that shaped thought during this time. It places humans and the belief in human goodness and achievement as supreme to divine beliefs. In humanism, Individuals are primary and the human race is compared to the individual. "Humanity is like individual members of the species" (Kelley, 217) 
•	Philology is the examination of the language and meaning behind the language of historical documents in a critical effort to examine the authenticity and original meaning of histories.  "The study of human speech especially as the vehicle of literature and as a field of study that sheds light on cultural history." (Miriam Webster Dictionary.) 
•	Academics believed that there are rights that inherently belong to humans and are part of the human condition.  We see the culmination of these beliefs in the French Revolution with the rhetoric of inalienable rights IE life, liberty, property. The belief in these rights is described as natural law. 
•	Hobbes and Locke debated about the social contract. They argued that individuals gave up some freedoms and liberties in order to form societies and benefit from the order and protection that these societies provided. The state of nature is contrasted with civil society. 
#Myth 
•	Vico and the Germanic myths- Myth could be discussed as interpreted by Vico- More research needed. 
Origins
•	The idea of origins during the enlightenment focuses on the state of nature and it is a topic of considerable debate. 
•	Scottish scholars tried “to project human behavior, and in particular language and religion, back into the state of nature and the animal condition of man” (Kelley, 234)
•	Adam Ferguson, from the University of Edinburgh, disagreed with Hobbes and Locke, for whom the state of nature was conjecture. In his “Essay on the History of Civil Society” he believes that the state of nature can be reconstructed and studied. His focus was the explanation of civilization and human nature through a universal history. 
•	Vico, in his work “universal law”  argues that laws are a “turning point in history” as opposed to the “feral stage of history. 
 Universal History
•	Near the middle of the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon published the comprehensive history of the Roman empire. “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.” 
•	Gibbon sought to use the new historical paradigm of seeking the deeper meaning behind historical events to explain the “why”. HE sought to explain the fall of the Roman empire through barbarians and “unenlightened attitudes” of the Roman Catholic church.
•	Gibbons history of Rome is a great example of the use of philology in history. Kelley says “for Gibbon every sentence implied a judgement, every paragraph had symmetrical shape no matter how confusing or obscure the facts of the matter.” (231) Gibbon was criticized that his writing style “is not style in which you can tell the truth.” (231) Gibbons work was seen more as story that of truth seeking history. 
•	Gibbons used extensive notes in the text of his work. This shows the growing importance of the importance and relevance of sources used. It is also a first example of citation in academic history.     
•	Gibbon also provides an example of another new introduction to history during the Enlightenment which is the inclusion of eastern histories within the context of western historical traditions.    
•	Time periods, or epochs of history were discussed widely. Childhood of the human race- Fontenelle. Voltaire saw four great ages of history, Greece, Rome, after the fall of Constantinople, and the era of Louis XIV in France. 
•	Education- "Condorcet taking a Lockean view of the psychological progress through sense experience, while Lessing preferred to identify it with revelation, and Ferguson thought in terms of social evolution." (217)
Access
•	The republic of letters represents a significant shift in the access to academic discourse.
•	The republic of letters was an international system of scholarship and criticism that spread the new ides through society. This enabled more accesses to the new ideas and debates of this time period.
•	I would like to talk about the access to books during this time but need more research.
#Cultural History
•	Herder- Cultural history- Philosophy. Progress not perfection. Herderer places people in the middle of the past and the present while
•	 Voltaire sees the past as culmination in the perfection of the present.
#Human Nature
•	Vico- Disagreement with Decartes with " I Make, therefore I know" 
•	David Hume believed that human nature could be found through the study of history. He said that history provided “materials from which we may form our observations, and become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and behavior.” (Kelley, 236) He believed that history provided a more nuanced insight into human nature than critical philosophy.
•	French historians believed that the study of history was to go beyond the chronical of history and seek the human spirit. 
•	Voltaire- Modern-Rejects older histories. Concerned with " The progress of the spirit" Kelley says the he wrote history to further his own agenda.
#Encyclopedia
•	Encyclopedia- Explain development and importance of. 
•	Dierot- Encyclopedia- Use of secondary sources.
•	D’Alembert
#National Differences
•	The cultural differences between states is evidenced through their different interpretations and beliefs in the utility of historical study "according to various national "prejudices," with Italian, French, British and German scholars interpreting according to different tastes and traditions." (219)
•	French historians believed that it was of utmost importance to use historical thought as a mean to improve the future. 
•	German history embraced the church while French histories turned away from the church.
#Research Methods
•	"Impartiality is the key to truth." (245) Discussion of Gottingen? 
•	Research methods in history improved significantly in Germany during this time. The use of sources, criticism
•	Criticism for Hume- "obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction involved in efforts to inquire into the history of remote ages." (236) 

•	
•	The republic of letters represents a Republic of letters- Could be defined and explained or it could be included in a subheding about access to Historical thought at the time. Human Nature- The use of history to understand human nature. Scottish Scholars."to project huan behavior back into the state of Nature" (234)
