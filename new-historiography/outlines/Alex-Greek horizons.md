*Herodotus*

- Tradition of "traveling, interviewing, and lecturing" around the Mediterranean world between the Pelopennesian Wars.

- Legend/Myth are not "baseless" fantasy and do not violate his vision of history. His version of history argued that smaller conjectural lessons contribute to a larger overall historical "trajectory."
    - In doing so Herodotus broadens the spectrum of historical enterprise into a new "historical space" by extending historical practice into the "mythical space."
    - Herodotus also conducted investigations into how the study of geography, religious and cultural custom, and questions of national origincontributed to the emerging notion of social and cultural history.

- Came to be seen as an "honest and objective historian" admired by successive generations of historians as the "father of history."
  - By some later as the father of anthropology as well
  
- Herododus "gives dramatic shape" to history. Weaving thematic elements of human emotion into his retelling of the events of his world and his attempt at the explanations of antiquity.

- Practically speaking Herodotus is the father of historical practice as his methods of practice and inquiry have continued to be cited and developed for over two and a half thousand years.

*Thucydides*

- History was a "project of writing" and Thucydides was content applying that project to his contemporary experience with the Pelopennesian War

- He avoids existential questions of myth and antiquity and margianalizes earlier works of classical prose.

- Pragmatically explains the success or failure of a "state" and limits his historical narrative to a discussion of the survival of the state (Athens in this case)

*Polybius*

- Shared an interest with Herodotus in explaining "barbarianism" as a threat to civilizations; and shared Thucydides interest in discussion of politics and the affairs of state; shared a desire with them both to create something unique with his work.
    - Actively avoided discussing myth, or geneology and only used archaeology for the sake of context.

- Enamored with the inevitability of the greatness of Rome and its place as the greatest thing to ever happen in the context of his deliberation over the origins of civil society.

- Pragmatic approach to human influence on historical events. "Human will or failing."

*The Idea of History*

- Thucydides and Herodotus did little to develop historiographical practice as a theoretical one which later became essential to the development of historiography as having a scientivic methodology of its own.
    - History is intimately related to a host of other human sciences: political philosophy, geography, theology, etc.
    
- Building on Polybius work, successive "historians" began to lend some theoretical credence to historical practice that would become significant later as history/historiography developed as an academic discipline.

- Literary style, political influence, and religious and moral inclination developed as concerns within the methodology of historical inquiry.
