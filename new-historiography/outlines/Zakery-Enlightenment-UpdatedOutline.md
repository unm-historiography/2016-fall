Zakery Rey Munoz | New Historiography Outline| The Enlightenment <br>________________________________________<br>
<b>Introduction | The Enlightenment Dudes</b><br><br>
After reading and rereading the chapter on the Enlightenment, I noticed a lack of context (obviously). I think introducing the reader to the Enlightenment a little would help, specifically because it was the age of reason. Another thing needed to be explained, as demonstrated in class is the natural law (introduced but fleshed out later). I think Newton, although brushed over in our chapters, should be highlighted here because he was a big influencer of the Enlightenment thinkers (again glance over him in the intro and flesh him out later). Was he a historian? Not really. He was a scientist thinking in dramatic ways and shapes – inspiring others to think about their shapes in dramatic ways; whatever their shape may be.
The actual chapter in the book starts off listing a bunch of Enlightenment dudes, and I feel like he doesn’t really mention all of them again (for the most part). I think for the most part a lot of their ideas are strong, but I don’t think the beginning of our chapter/webpage needs to begin by drowning the reader with all the exhaustion of names. Too many names. We can introduce them slowly.<br>
* Introduction to the Enlightenment<br>
* Age of Reason<br><br>

<b>Part 1 | The Enlightenment and Newton</b><br><br>
So I keep changing my mind on how I want to structure this. But I think the body of the first few paragraphs can go over what I mentioned above in the introduction. I remember in class that I made a case for having an epilogue rather than a prologue. As I am writing this outline, I’m thinking that both might be needed. I think and introduction to the concepts, the dudes, and spiel is necessary, but save all of the digesting until the end maybe. I think a subject like Historiography demands context. Demands it.
Anyway, I will use this paragraph to flesh out the early days. Like I already mentioned, I think Newton is a necessary Enlightenment powerhouse that we cannot fail to mention in this chapter. I will not allow it. <br><br>
* The Human Spirit<br>
* Newton<br>
* Natural Law<br><br>

<b>Part 2 | Age of Reason & Natural Law| Philosophy</b><br><br>
So this stuff confused most of the class (and rightly so). I think it’s worth going into more detail about what the thinkers are thinking. The philosophy is particularly important here, so I think it’s worth mentioning before we get into the gritty historians. Because really the Enlightenment was a time that melded historians with philosophers. You know, reason, purpose, rationality, meaning. 


* Philosophy<br>
* Kant<br>
* Locke<br>
* Condorcet<br>
* Voltair<br><br>

<b>Part 3 | The Historiography of Reason</b><br><br>
Alright I think it’s safe to start talking about how people were doing history now. I feel like I just have a list of names, but I really want some meaning out of them… which is appropriate given the chapter. But I guess a strong conclusion is necessary for this part. So the reader can digest what I just tossed at them. I think the earlier parts will give enough context into why these guys did what they did, and then the end can make sense of it all. I can’t decide who to start with because of weird the introduction to this chapter is in the book.<br><br> But I think it’s safe to start with <i>Vico.</i> 
* He wrote the New Science which is basically a new encyclopedia (this would be a secondary source I would be interested in skimming and grabbing some useful quotes for our purposes). I want to start with him because Kelley mentioned his text was like “the quest of a full historical meaning” (223). This idea seems to sum up the Enlightenment right? 
<br><br>
  * New Science
  * A new Encyclopedia
  * “Historical Meaning”
  * Universal History

I’m having trouble placing <i>Gibbon</i>, 
* But he is second on my list of dudes (A list that is in no particular order). Anyway, he wrote about what mankind did after Rome. Which is pretty interesting to be fair because Rome is this historical MECHA. I like “his mission was to combine erudition and literature” (228). Again, these dudes seem to be super universal here.<br><br>
  * Aftermath of the Roman Empire.
  * Erudition and Literature
  * Universal History

<i>Cassirer</i> wrote a lot of jazz.
* It’s really hard to separate the philosophers from the historians, because, well, they are doing the same thing really. This guy is a good example of that. History of modern thought and what not. The guy who “continued [the] potency of the humanist tradition” (221).<br><br>
  * Good example of the blurring line between historians and philosophy.
  * Humanist

<i>Ferguson</i> is up next. 
* I read a little about him (outside Kelley), and apparently he is worthy of the title “father of modern sociology” whatever that means. But he seemed to take all of the differing psychological approaches to history and write “the history of the individual is but a detail of sentiments and thoughts he has entertained in the view of his species”. We’re getting to the good stuff here. Trying to cope with this historiography mess. We’re getting somewhere, and I think Herder is going to drive it home for us. Maybe. Probably not.<br><br> 
  * Father of modern Sociology
  * Combining all the ideas and extracting some meaning from them.

<i>Herder</i> loved trees. He was all about them. 
* But really I think Herder is a good place to stop in terms of talking about dudes and what they did (similar to Kelley). We read a little of Herder’s text and it was pretty dense. Herder wrote “The history of man is ultimately a theatre of transformations, which he alone can review, who animates all these figures, and feels and enjoys in them all” (248). This is great for the overarching theme of the chapter.<br><br>
  * A lot like Ferguson in the respect of universality and meaning




<b>Part 4 | Wrapping it up | French Revolution?| American Constitution?</b><br><br>
I think where I left off with all of the dudes leaves a good spot to start thinking about what this all meant, and why we study it, and why it matters, and so forth. The French Revolution and the American Declaration of Independence are influence BIG TIME from all of this mess. It would require some more research, but I don’t think it would hurt to correlate the events with the thoughts. You know?
At any rate. This is where I want to talk about what it all meant for history because, as I’ve said and as we’ve mentioned in class, this history that we are seeing is very much like what we do today. If not exactly what we do today. Except for all the Postmodern nut cases, but still I feel like they are poking at the same ideas just in different respects. Anyway, I don’t want to talk Postmodern right now. I’ll let them speak for themselves. But I think I want to talk about how the Enlightenment paved the way for Modernism (eventually Postmodernism, but if we really think about it Postmodernism is Modernism because you can never have the post without the modern). Anyway, I think most people (and when I say most people I mean the half educated kid-adult out there) have a general idea about how we do history now. So I think correlating the ideas in a meaningful way is appropriate. This is just an outline so I haven’t done too much dirty work. But here we have it. 
  * French Revolution
  * American Declaration of Independence/Constitution
  * Why it matters
  * Indicative of how we do history now
  
I thought I would bring in some quotes from Kelley and possibly Jenkins here and then expand on them as I wrap up the chapter.<br><br><b>Quotes to expand on.</b><br>(Forgive me as I drop quotes.)<br>
* “History remained in the shadows of the Enlightenment” (218). 
* “History remained philosophy teaching by example” (219). 
* The Human Spirit - “whose purpose was not merely to chronicle the word and deeds of men but also to reconstruct the ‘history of the human spirt/mind” (239). 
* “The education of the human race” (217).
