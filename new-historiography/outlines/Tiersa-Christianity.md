**Judeo-Christian**

1. **Transcendent History**
  1. Judeo-Christian historiography looked at humankind as a whole and created a *universal history*. 
      * All humans had a *common origin* and looked forward to an *eschatological ending* of history.
      * Every event in history had a divine being working within that event-this being became the **_God of History_**.
      * *Jewish scriptures* gave this historical account of God working through the history of the Israelites with a providential plan in mind. 
      * Christians saw this same God becoming a *turning point* of history through the *incarnation* of Jesus. 
	       * Pagans *unknowingly* spoke of Jesus and through his incarnation humans found *real meaning* in their history and history would continue to play out until the Second Coming.
      * They began to *interpret* and find a *deeper* meaning in history and human actions.
        
2. **Josephus**
  1. He established *early chronology* of humankind by incorporating this God of History. 
  2. Although he tried to present the truth he still incorporated *Myth* (ie Tower of Babel) and “proved” its truth by comparing it with pagan stories.
  
3. **Clement of Alexandria** 
  1. Built a strong *bridge* between Paganism and Christianity
  2. History became *universal* rather than national as Josephus presented it. 
  3. Emphasized the word and law of God as **_truth_**; and Jewish and Pagan culture held *partial* truth until the truth was revealed in Jesus-thus the turning point. 
  
4. **Eusebius** 
	1. He *expanded* on the work of chronology in history.
	2. He saw history as a *continuum* and focused on recording this succession.

5. **Orosius** 
	1. He *strictly* followed history chronologically.
	2. He wrote history from the *beginning of sin* down to the present day (his day).
  
6. **The Influence of Judeo-Christian Historiography**
	1. Chronology
	2. Do we still see history as somewhat universal?
	3. Interpreting history and giving it meaning.
  
*I know that Kelley writes a lot about Augustine but I don’t feel that he is very relevant to our understanding. Every time I read that section either I am lost or Kelley is grasping at straws because I don’t see his point. I think that Augustine could pretty much be skipped and no one would notice. What do you all think?*
