# **Judeo-Christian**
 1. **Transcendent History (Themes)**
    1. Judeo-Christian historiography looked at humankind as a whole and created a *universal* history. *“Through monotheism, the story of         Judaism turned national history into universal history”* (80-81).
      *	All humans had a common origin and looked forward to an *eschatological* ending of history.
        * *Judeo-Christian history looked backward to origins, and forward to an eschatological goal* (75).
      * *“For Christians and Jews alike history was not merely deeds done, and recorded, according to human ambitions and designs limited only by incalculable fortune and inscrutable fate; beyond this it was a progression of actions, an ordeal carried on within a providential plan”* (75). 
      * For Judeo-Christian history God was unfolding history-thus making the **God of History**. 
         * *“The Jewish view of history came to involve both projection into the future...and...retrojection into the past, according to which ideas and meaning emerging in a later period were imposed on accounts of the past”* (76). 
	 * Augustine wrote, *“’For events which have already occurred and cannot be undone are to be considered as part of world order, whose founder and ruler is God.’ Thus ‘history itself’ was not a matter of words but, no less than nature itself, a creation of God”* (95).
      * Christians saw this same God becoming a *turning point* of history through the incarnation of Jesus. *“Hebrew Scriptures were present at the birth of Christianity, as was the memory of a pagan past...that were to be cast off or fulfilled in the name of a new dispensation and, eventually, a new foundation and starting point for chronology. This ‘new song’...was the Word celebrated by St. John, which would replace...paganism.”* (80).
         * Pagans unknowingly spoke of Jesus and through his incarnation humans found real meaning in their history and history would continue to play out until the Second Coming. *“...the whole process of history was a ‘preparation for the Gospel,’ and it was in these terms that the Christian vision of history was formed by scholars, theologians, and preachers of the Word. It was in these terms, too, that the faces of Herodotus and Thucydides and their epigones made fitful appearances”* (84). 
     * They began to *interpret* and *impose* meaning in history and human actions. *“The story of early Christianity...centers on the question of how to make sense of the past, even if it meant imposing meaning”* (84). 
 2. **Josephus**
    1. Josephus was considered a *pragmatic* historian. 
     * *“Josephus professed to be as devoted to the truth as he was to his nation; although celebrating the venerable past of Israel, he also spent much polemical energy defending himself against contemporary Jewish accusers and attacking earlier historians who had failed in their respect for one or another of his ideals”* (78).
   2. He combined *human* history with *natural* history: 
     * *“Josephus took a broader view of human history, incorporating natural history as well”* (78). He did this by interpreting nature after discussing creation in the Jewish Archaeology. 
   3. Although he tried to present the *truth* he still incorporated Myth (ie Tower of Babel) and “proved” its truth by comparing it with pagan stories.
    * *“The story of Babel was confirmed, Josephus remarks, by the Sibylline oracle of the Romans...” and “here Josephus offered his own eponymous etymologies (equally mythical) to replace those of the Greek culture overlay”* (79). 
   4. Josephus introduced a universal history:
    * *“For the Jewish nation the ideal was associated not only with monotheism but also with an impulse to universalism, expressed historiographically in attempts, such as that of Josephus, to subsume the histories of other nations into the biblical account and chronology”* (79). 
 3. **Clement of Alexandria**
    1. Built a **strong** bridge between Paganism and Christianity: 
      * *“Clement of Alexandria built an even stronger bridge between paganism and Christianity, representing Greek philosophy as a preparation for Christian truth while criticizing it as plagiarized from antecedent ‘barbarian’ wisdom”* (82).
    2. Clement gave his own interpretation on the use of chronology. 
      * *“Human chronology was but a pale reflection of God’s timetable, but the great system of correspondences which mystical theologians saw lining heaven and earth made it possible to ascend, at least in though, from one sphere to another”* (83).
 4. **Eusebius**
    1. He *expanded* on the work of chronology in history and tried to further its universality:
     * *“Eusebius was committed to fixing an accurate chronology for the scriptural canon and the successions which he retraced and also for the events of whose meaning was emerging in the light of the Christian Word”* (87).
     * *“This was the purpose of his Chronological Canons, which attempted to synchronize pagan and Judeo-Christian history through a wide range of sources, including the anti-Christian chronology of Porphyry, by aligning the Olympiadic system with regnal lists, historians’ calculations, biblical genealogy beginning with Abraham, and historical information in the so called spatium historicum between the columns"* (87). 
    2. Eusebius was a firm believer in the God of History: 
     * *“Eusebius was the proud champion of a higher cause, which was expressed within a framework so plainly revealed in Holy Scriptures that there seemed little for a historian to accomplish except to fix the sequence and parallelism of events and to collect the words that testified to the providential plan...which the “inspired record” had laid down and which survived in a variety of secular forms, including the modern idea of secular progress”* (88).
 5. **Orosius**
    1. He strictly followed history chronologically.
     * *“He followed a strictly chronological order calculated piously “from the founding of the city” even for the years after the birth of Christ”* (93). 
    2. Orosius was an advocate for Jesus as the turning point of history:
     * *“The governing will of God was finally made manifest in the incarnation mission, and martyrdom of his Son in the period of Augustus, when the temple of Janus was again closed to mark the establishment of imperial peace”* (94).
