## Mythistory Chapter Outline

***Questions, Ideas, and Themes***

1. History emerged from myth (p. 1)-
    1. According to Kelley, *history* emerged from *myth*, and forced itself into stories/legends until it gained full insight. But when exactly did this happen? Was it during the time of Machivelli? Or Voltaire? Or is it still gaining understanding in the current century? The answer to this question will probably never achieve a definite answer, because it seems that as long as there are people around to record it, the subject of history will forever be changing and gaining wisdom and knowledge by those studying it.
    
2. Recording history requires a degree of prejudice (p. 1)-
    1. We are never fully able to see past our deepest prejudices with either history or myth, as Kelley states, but when it comes to "working on myth" or "historicizing," this allows us to remain critical of our work and question the sources we are using. Without our deepest predjudices present in our minds, we wouldn't be able to write history. 
    
3. What qualifies as history? (p. 3)-
    1. A *myth* or *traditional story* concerning the early history of a group of people, or that helps to explain some sort of natural or social occurence. 
    2. An *epic poem*, which usually discusses heroic deeds and events that are significant to the *culture* of the poet. 
    3. *Lists of priests and kings* that kept track of important people in different societies. 
    4. *Chronology*, regarding the arrangement of events kept in order by the dates they occured on. 
    5. All of these genres became a form of history before "history" even existed, and helped provide Herodotus with materials/models for his own work. 
    
4. Three important matters about the "art of history" (p. 7)-
    1. *Scope*:
        * This involves subject matter, chronology, geography, and historical evidence that has been passed down through the generations verbally (or written down by scribes), which historians have found worthy/useful to make note of. 
    2. *Method*:
        * This involves the means of gathering the above information and making sense of it/re-writing it, primarily to transfer to the public sphere.
    3. *Purpose*:
        * This involes the value claimed for the study of history, and what would later become known as the philosophy of history.
    4. All of the above matters can be projected on a small or large scale, intended for local or global usage. 
        
5. Geohistory (p. 8)-

    1. Historians have always attempted to relate *human behavior/nature* with its enviornment, which also includes social and natural contexts that help to locate and distinguish it from other cultures and communities. 
        
6. Truth (pp. 10-11)-
    1. The most essential theme to survive constant changes in language, culture, ideology, and human values is the issue of *truth*, but what does *truth* mean? It has always exhibited different natures and histories, but each meaning is somehow always united into one single idea; truth is **not** a *static value*, and has its own kind of *destiny*. 
    
7. Time and Experience (p. 11)-
    1. The experience of passing time cannot be captured, except for in language, which unfortunately offers a poor representation of individual memories and knowledge.
    2. Past events are always in the present tense, and are seen in how we speak, write, listen, read, and even remember things.
        
8. Memory (p. 11)-
    1. History is often regarded to as a combination of different memories, but this causes more problems than it solves because *memory is selective*. For example, a huge problem that historians have to take into consideration is that stories that have been passed down through different generations have been changed multiple times, which makes it much more difficult to distinguish the made up parts from the parts that actually did occur. 
        
***Important People***

1. Herodotus (p. 2)-
    1. Known as the "father of history" and the "father of lies," Herodotus was a Greek historian who greatly enjoyed recording history by means of story-telling. He was the first historian to systematically collect sources, test the legitimacy of them (to an extent), and arranged his materials into well-constructed narratives/tales. His large-scale historical narrative has managed to survive throughout the centuries.  
        
2. Thucydides (p. 2)-
    1. Known as the "second founding father of history," Thucydides concentrated his efforts on politics and the military. His writings on the Peloponnesian War rejected the story-telling narrative that Herodotus was so fond of, and eventually coined the term *the Thucydidean Model*, which included eyewitness testimony, personal experience, and observable facts (amongst other things) as a way of recording history. He approached his studies in a more analytical manner, thus allowing his readers to come up with their own conclusions from his works. 
        
***Myth in different cultures***

1. The Egyptians (pp. 13-14)-
    1. The Egyptians supplied many examples of historical inquiry and interpretation for historians over the course of time because they were a society that help vast interest in the origins of the universe, their gods, geneologies, chronology, victories over their enemies, and the afterlife
    2. The Palermo Stone is one example of their efforts to record their history. 
        * The stone containts inscriptions of regnal lists on one of six fragments of a giant slab.
    3. Social memory during the time of the Egyptians was embodied in architecture and funeral remains. Pyramids and monuments were used in Egyptian myths to help preserve memories.
            
2. The Greeks (pp. 13, 15)-
    1. Philosophy and science have made Greece the starting point for the story of the *human condition* in time.
    2. Proto-historiographical forms of writing in Greek culture included:
        * *Genealogy*, a line of descent traced continuously from a specific ancestor. 
        * *Geography*, the study of human activity, including the distribution of populations and resources over time.
        * *Ethnography*, the scientific description of the customs of different cultures and groups of people. 
        * *Local history*, studying the patterns and behavior of the people in ones own community. 
    3. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks also expressed an interest in chronology.
        * *Hellanicus*, a contemporary Greek writer, attempted to create a comparative study of the chronologies of the Greeks and barbarian tribes, but was ultimately unable to remove the *mythical* aspects from his work to make it more historically accurate.
