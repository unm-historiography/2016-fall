The Science of History explains the major transformations of history, in particular it’s transformation from an art to a science.  Transforming history is never unanimous, and there were many (and still are) historians who disagree with each other.  

**History as an art**

- History was always divided by *style* and *truth*.  The problem with history was style and truth could never coexist. 
-  History as an art used grammar and rhetoric, and was considered to be moral philosophy, and/or poetry.   
- History was considered an art by itself and because of its connections to other humanities.
- Dionysius of Halicarnassus said “philosophy is teaching by example”, and the Renaissance considered history as a *moral philosophy* (188).
- History begins to branch from being solely an art by its particular and literal truth. 
 - This was also what separated it from poetry.
 
 **The Method of History**
 
-  The beginning of historiography was not original to the Renaissance.
	 - It came from antiquity, especially from Herodotus and Thucydides’s views.
- The writings of ancient philosophers were translated and *transformed* into what applied to the modern era.
	 - The *transformed* literary texts from antiquity were to help guide decisions.  Hindsight is 20/20, and learning from the past would be useful to all types of people (188).
- The key to history becoming a science, was as simple as organization.
 - ***Organization*** gave structure to knowledge.
 - It put an emphasis on genealogy, which was important to the *Ciceronian Laws* (190).
    - Some (Vives) didn’t like how pagan history was better recorded than Christian history.
- History had so many contributors and variations to the same event, it is impossible for there to be no dishonesty (191).
 - History brings a "singular wisdom", but it has its flaws as well.
   - Some of which are; political gains, lust, greed, military glory, and/or religious ambition.
-“Sixteenth-century historians loved the idea of disposition of narrative, the requirements of cause, analysis and critical judgment, the need for impartiality, and the priority (neglected by the ancients) of ***truth over beauty***” (196).
- Bartholomeus Keckermann
 - History was a mode of arrangement, rather than subject matter.
 - Criticized disorganization 
	- Claimed history was only truthful when it was combined with other fields; like economic and political.
		 - Thus making it a science
	- Common sixteenth-century views were history only addressed particular facts, “lacking the status of particular truth” (196”.
- ***History was a science, only through the application of reason***
 - It had no further meaning than to what it described, and no conception of time.
- For Milieu, Baudouin, Bodin, Gaillard, La Popeliniere, and Bacon history adopted all the arts and sciences to inform the modern civiliztion.
 - It was divided into three parts; human, natural, and divine (198).
 
**Criticism of History**
- In the Renaissance criticism was finding forgeries in the writing, while making sure all the information given was true.
- History that had been written long ago was seen with more skepticism than in previous generations.  Writings from antiquity were more closely analyzed, and suspected to be untrustworthy; this “Descartes proposed to eradicate the past and memory as the primary source of error.” (pg 204).  
- The Renaissance contributed greatly to the **transformation** of history.  A completely new way of writing and reading history developed from this time period, “The conjunction of these impulses with archaeology and anthropology in a modern sense marked the beginning of an enlightened and truly (if in some cases excessively speculative) philosophical history."(216).
