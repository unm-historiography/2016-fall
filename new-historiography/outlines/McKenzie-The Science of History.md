The Science of History chapter explains the how history transformed from an art to a science during the Renaissance. The transformation of history wasn't a unanimous decision, and there were many (and still are) different viewpoints to why history falls into a particular category.  History has always been divided by *style* and *truth*.  This is problematic, because style and truth couldn’t coexist.

**History as an Art**

- History as an art used grammar and rhetoric.  It was considered to be moral philosophy or poetry.
 - Dionysius of Halicarnassus said “philosophy is teaching by example”, and the Renaissance considered history as a *moral philosophy (188).  
- History was considered an art by itself and because of its connections to other humanities.
- History begins to branch from being solely an art by its particular and literal truth. 
 - This was also what separated it from poetry.
 
 **The Method of History**
 
- The beginning of historiography was not original to the Renaissance, it came from antiquity, especially from Herodotus and Thucydides’ views.
- The writings of ancient philosophers were translated and *transformed* into what applied to the modern era.
 - The *transformed* literary texts from antiquity helped dictate human decisions.  Hindsight is 20/20, and learning from the past would be useful for all types of people (188).
- The key to history becoming a science was organization.
 - ***Organization*** gave structure to knowledge.
 - It put an emphasis on genealogy, which was important to the *Ciceronian Laws* (190).
    - Some (Vives) didn’t like how pagan history was better recorded than Christian history.
- History had so many contributors and variations to the same event, it is impossible for there to be no dishonesty (191).
 - History brings a "singular wisdom", but it has its flaws as well.
   - Some of which are; political gains, lust, greed, military glory, and/or religious ambition.
-“Sixteenth-century historians loved the idea of disposition of narrative, the requirements of cause, analysis and critical judgment, the need for impartiality, and the priority (neglected by the ancients) of ***truth over beauty***” (196).
- Bartholomeus Keckerman said history was a mode of arrangement, rather than subject matter.
 - Criticized disorganization 
	- Claimed history was only truthful when it was combined with other fields.  Economics and politics were among these fields. 
	- Thus making it a science
	- Common sixteenth-century views of history only addressed particular facts, “lacking the status of particular truth” (196”.
- ***History was a science, only through the application of reason***
 - It had no further meaning than to what it described, and no conception of time.
- For Milieu, Baudouin, Bodin, Gaillard, La Popeliniere, and Bacon history adopted all the arts and sciences to inform the modern civilization.
 - History was related to law according to Jean Bodin.  Bodin divided history into three laws; human, nature, and divine.  Human history was “whatever flowed from the will of mankind, which ever vacillates and has no objective” (198).

 **The Art of Criticism **

- In the Renaissance criticism was finding forgeries in the writing, while making sure all the information given was true.
- History that had been written long ago was seen with more skepticism than in previous generations.  Writings from antiquity were more closely analyzed, and suspected to be untrustworthy.  Bude wanted a “restitution” of antiquity as a whole.  (pg 205).  
- The Renaissance contributed greatly to the **transformation** of history.  A completely new way of writing and reading history developed from this time period, “The conjunction of these impulses with archaeology and anthropology in a modern sense marked the beginning of an enlightened and truly (if in some cases excessively speculative) philosophical history."(216).
 -Critic, a word which began as medical term, then turned into a literary one, led to an important part in historical development. Debating the great authors of the past was a new way to find a closer truth.
