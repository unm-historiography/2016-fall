-**Reforming History**-

-In this chapter I intend to highlight the key themes and people of the reformation period, as well as show how these themes and the profession of history differ from previous eras and impact the subsequent. 
- Side note, if it’s not obvious, I’m tentatively planning on making individual sections for key themes and people. I also intend on littering side notes throughout but as of now I cant even figure out how to do that on MS word much less Github. 

-**Main Themes**

-**How History was Regarded** 
- Throughout the reformation history was looked at through a critical lens and occupied a polemical role (p163). While insistently critical, historians--as a profession--were regarded higher than many times. Often this higher regard was used in attempts to link history to various agendas, Protestants attempted to link their own traditions to that of older traditions. 

-**Duality**
- During the reformation, and distinct from earlier eras, there was a distinct **duality of church and state, sacred and secular** and this duality allowed for two completely separate narratives to emerge (p163).
- There was a complete collapse of the religiously centered national identity and further emphasis placed on national narratives to build the identity of the people. 
- Idea of **"Confessional History"** emerges during the 16th century and, "in many ways pluralized, politicized, and polemicized, subverting the master narrative of Christian universal history." p169
- The idea of **universal history** codified as a distinct narrative during the reformation and allowed a broadening of accessibility to said history. 
- Alongside these two, another history emerged and placed a further focus on looking at **individual histories** and the importance of humans in and on history--**humanism**.
- This was a time for immense growth in the both the field of historiography, and in the potential for history to grow out of being regarded as merely an art to being respected as a science, "yet the rhetoric of historical impartiality, disinterested curiosity, and scientific aspirations remained; and even the most committed historians contributed, if only inadvertently, to the project of historical inquiry--to tell the truth, be humanly useful, and perhaps even be a way to wisdom. **Clinging to these ideals--and at the same time vastly increasing the quantity, accessibility, and critical understanding of source materials--history reinforced its potential to become a true science**." p187

-**Origins in the Reformation**
- Origins during the reformation differ greatly from earlier eras in that there is a departure from Roman roots as the source of legitimization, and the "barbarian" cultures begin to look inward to their own traditions to establish identity, meaning and a place in history.
- Perhaps this departure marks a "progression of empires"-empires that are constantly changing throughout history but at the same time building upon each previous eras traditions and ideals. 

-**Agenda**
- The agenda of many historians during the reformation was two-part. There was the church and religious institutions, which still remained very powerful. Pushing up against the church was a strong movement towards a more secular agenda. This duality of the spiritual and the secular caused two distinct narratives to dominate the reformation. These two narratives, while not altogether groundbreaking, were a new way for history to be approached as a profession. 





-**Influential People (Person?)**

-**Johann Sleidan**-
- Johann Sleidan was a 16th century **Humanist** with a law degree, hired as the official historiographer of Germany
- Sleidan was staunchly adherent to evidence and famously said, "I would rather die than say, still less write, anything without proof"(169). This was not necessarily new, perhaps the zealous adherence was, but marked a change in the way professional historians approached their practice.
