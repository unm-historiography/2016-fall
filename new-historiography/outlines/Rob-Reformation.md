-**Reformation**-
- **Main Themes**
- "Polemical role which history occupied during the reformation." p163
- During the reformation there was a distinct **duality of church and state, sacred and secular**. p163
- Attempts to link Protestant history to old traditions.
- Complete collapse of religiously centered national identity with further emphasis on national narratives to build said identity. 
- Idea of **"Confessional History"** emerges during the 16th century and, "in many ways pluralized, politicized, and polemicized, subverting the master narrative of Christian universal history." p169
- Creation of idea of **universal history**, as well as broadening of accessibility to said history. 
- Local histories began emerging and place a further focus on looking at individual histories and the importance of humans in and on history--**humanism**.
- This was a time for immense growth in the both the field of historiography, and the potential for history to grow out of being regarded as merely an art to being respected as a science, "yet the rhetoric of historical impartiality, disinterested curiosity, and scientific aspirations remained; and even the most committed historians contributed, if only inadvertently, to the project of historical inquiry--to tell the truth, be humanly useful, and perhaps even be a way to wisdom. **Clinging to these ideals--and at the same time vastly increasing the quantity, accessibility, and critical understanding of source materials--history reinforced its potential to become a true science**." p187


- **Origins**
- Departure from Roman roots, now these "barbarian" cultures are beginning to look inward to their own traditions.
- Perhaps this departure is part of the "progression of empires"-empires that are constantly changing throughout history but at the same time building upon on another each time. 

- **National Histories**
- **Do these add anything to the goal of this chapter?** I will argue no but I'm obviously open to having my mind changed. 

- **People**
-Johann Sleidan-
- humanist with a law degree, hired as the official historiographer of Germany
- "I would rather die than say, still less write, anything without proof". p169
-Martin Luther-
- Protestant reformation 
- Perhaps a link to a trusted source 
-Henry VIII
- English King 
- Perhaps a link to a trusted source



- **Agenda**
- The agenda of historians during the reformation was two part. There was the church and religious institutions, which still remained very powerful. Pushing up against the church was a strong movement towards a more secular agenda. 
- Nations formerly regarded as barbarians now focus on their own traditions and histories and, taking a play from the Romans, use these to build strong national identities.
