•	Medieval chroniclers, and the growing lack of distinction between chronicles and histories

•	History in the middle ages was (at least to an extent) inextricably tied to scripture and Christian theology

•	Shift from centralized history being “all about Rome,” and excluding the “barbarians” to each nation, having arisen from various barbarian tribes, writing its own history
•	General theme of “Rome is gone, now nothing else matters,” leading to the term “The Dark Ages”

•	National traditions-the appearance of distinctive historical themes written by the English, Germans, French, etc. 

•	Learning of history was largely restricted to the elite, who unlike most, were literate.  Everyone else only heard translations of scripture from the clergy at church
