•	Medieval chroniclers and the growing lack of distinction between chronicles and histories are an important theme in the middle ages.  There was a greater emphasis on chronology, especially Christian chronology.

•	History in the middle ages was (at least to an extent) inextricably tied to scripture and Christian theology.  Much of it was simply to keep track of sacred events in the timeline of human history.

•	There was a major shift from centralized history being “all about Rome,” and excluding the “barbarians” to each nation, having arisen from various barbarian tribes, writing its own history.  Later on, however, each nation would seek to validate its own history by tying it back to Rome.

•	There was a general theme of “Rome is gone, now nothing else matters,” leading to the term “The Dark Ages,” which lasted from the fall of the empire until the Renaissance.  

•	There was a rise of national traditions-the appearance of distinctive historical themes written by the English, Germans, French, etc., whereas they were once considered barbarians, and were on the peripheries of the Roman Empire, and therefore of little significance.  

•	The learning of history was largely restricted to the elite, who unlike most, were literate.  Everyone else only heard translations of scripture from the clergy at church.  Clerics had to learn to read Latin, just so they could translate the Bible, and Latin was no longer commonly read or spoken.
