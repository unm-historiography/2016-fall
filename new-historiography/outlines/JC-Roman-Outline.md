Romans are important to history because they were the model for the different eras that follow them. The major players that wrote the history for Rome are important because they started writing the history down and keeping a record. Rhetoric was very important during this time because the Caesar being the leader of the people and the people followed.

Romans

- **A History of Rome**
 - Why was Rome the center of history?-
    Looking at the real reason why the people all agreed to call a city the start of history.
    Romans having a thing about property. Not just land, but with other human beings. 
The start of the Roman Empire was with the city itself. Rome was the heart of the empire
 - Why "**All Roads Lead To Rome**"- 
    Answaering the question "why all roads lead to Rome?" That "Romans measured time from the founding of the city" (pg. 48). 
    
The start of the Rome Empire was with the city itself. Livy who is considered one of the founder father of history and along with all other Romans agreed that their history started with the fromation of Rome. The reason for this is that Romans measure time with the start of Rome and not before. The events that took place before the power of Rome was completed are recorded, but not considered that start of the Roman history. It is not considered the start of their history because the build up to the full power of Rome was not in full effect at the time. Rome was under the rule of a monarchy and the repbulic or as Livy called it "new liberty" (Kelly, pg. 58) took control and started a better Rome. When the Roman Empire was in swing command and conquer with expansion was the priority. The Romans took what is now Europe and made sure that Rome was the heart of the empire even though the city was not in the center. The saying "all roads lead to Rome" is very important because no matter where a person was in the empire, Rome was always the true center in their hearts. It is also a truth for the ages because hints of the Roman Empire are all around and a part of every day life.

Theme
- **Rhetoric** 
 - What is rhetoric and why is it important-
 
Rhetoric is "the art or skill of speaking or writing formally and effectively especially as a way to persuade or influence people" (Merriam-Webster.com). We can say that Roman rhetoric had a major influence on the rest of the world after the fall of Rome. The Romans were very good with rhetoric. It could be said that it started underground while the monarchy rule was in power before the the rise of the republic.  Rhetoric used by Cesar, the senate, and historians like Livy and Cicero shaped the minds of many Romans. Cesar and members of the senate use rhetoric to speak to the people and soldiers of Rome for many reasons. For example, when Rome wanted to expand Cesar would give a speech to get the people that was very motivational for support. The other side of rhetoric is writing. Kelly tells us the "first law" (Kelly, pg. 66) is to tell the truth no matter what. Livy and Tacitus both wrote the history they lived. Livy wrote history during the monarchy and the new republic. This was important because the history changed in front of Livy and he wrote about because it was an important event, but it was not considered part of the republic history except the overthrow. Tatcitus followed Livy and wrote his life and the events that took place during it.
