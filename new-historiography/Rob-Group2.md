- Each of the histories we've read about have, in one way or another, had a broader philosophy around them. Should we include a small section about this for each chapter? 

- As discussed last week, I really like David and Zackery's idea of organizing by era and having individual tabs for each. 

- I believe we've come to a consensus about the use of hyperlinks to explain the overload of names, dates and historical information, but we need to figure out what sources we deem reliable enough. I personally don't think Wikipedia is sufficient, but I may be in the minority. 

- How does cultural history differ from the national histories we've read about already? Should we include it? 

- I think themes are probably the most important aspect to discuss, but I believe the website should be organized chronologically with the themes highlighted within each era. 

- Should we have an introduction or conclusion to each section to bring everything together and explain our argument?
