Generally this period of historiography appears to be a *new combination of old ideas*, or the same idea with a new 
*explanation*. As we have seen before, historians in this time set out to create a kind of methodology for history. While 
this method was maybe more **systematic** then we have seen, it by no means appears new (p.193).  There was an emphasis on 
**truth** and **objectivity** (p.199).  There was a return to the necessity of **origins** (p.201).  Criticism during the 
time did seem to take on a new light simply because as discussed in the pervious chapter, the historians were dealing with a 
large volume of histories and were in the business of discrediting the *“bad”* ones (p.205).  All in all “The Science of 
History”, to me at least, seems to be a **rehashing** of old ideas and methods.  

There are two things from this chapter that I think are worth talking about and present something we haven’t exactly seen so 
far:
1. On page 194 Kelley quotes from Baudouin saying that history “was a theater in which man was not only ‘spectator’ and 
‘interpreter’ but also **‘actor’**; and this at once facilitated and complicated writing and understanding history”.  We have 
kind of danced around this conflict in regards to subjectivity but haven’t ever addressed how actually playing a part in 
history effects historians.  I would say we have talked about historians as “spectator" and “interpreter" but not “actor”.  
It seems different to me.  Bascially I am asking if the "actor" category different then what we have discussed in the past?

2. On page 208, Kelley asks “What kind of truth could history bring to an age in quest of certainty?”.  This chapter in part
overlaps the Enlightenment which emphasized the importance of **evidence** and didn’t simply accept things as the truth.  I 
have a professor that says the motto of the Enlightenment should have been “On the other hand, I could be wrong”, if that’s the 
case then how can a *“true”* history exist during this time?  There really is no way to prove history not in the way Newton 
could prove that gravity existed. So how would the **inability** to create an acceptable true history effect the writing of 
history?  It would seem that unlike before truth is **valued** but completely **unattainable**.
