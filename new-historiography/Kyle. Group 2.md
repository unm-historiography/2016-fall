1. I believe having the format be a chronological timeline of how history has changed would be best, and within each era of historiography we cover the main themes of historiography (which we introduce in the introduction) and how each *historiography* contributed to historiography as a methodology. The format could possibly be something like 1.Time period 2.Themes or a more focused analysis of a part of that time period 3. within the sub-category of theme/focused-time-period we could discuss the different historiographers or the changes in historiography.
2. We could probably have a webpage dedicated to a set number of historiographers and just introduce their circumstances, their place in the chronology of history, and a *little* on how they aided history. Maybe just a 5-6 sentence paragraph for each historiographer. 
3. We should discuss what **Themes** are the most important in historiography. A list of a few possible themes: Universal History, Methodology, Ideology, the role of political power, Cultural context, the importance of truth, Historical criticism of sources, and criticism of one another or previous historiographers.
