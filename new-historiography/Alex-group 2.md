Kelley focus heavily on breaking down historiographical methodology and practice by chronological era: Greek, Roman, Christian, etc...while the reason for this is obvious...the past is chronological; I believe that we woul dbe far better served by analyzing historiography from a practical and ideological standpoint rather than a chronological one. I agree that throughout the historical chronicle historiography generally followed certain temporal norms that is not always the case. Take for example Petrarch and his idolization of Romanesque practice. I think following thematic elements in practical historiography would make the study easier to relate to and students can thus get a more holistic picture of how historiographical practice was done in ideological time series cross-sections that include practices from more than one chronological period in a single concise analytical narrative.
