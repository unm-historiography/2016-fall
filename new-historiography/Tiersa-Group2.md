I **_really_** like the idea of not necessarily writing a *book* but doing a website where we can access the material we write. So maybe more of a *interactive ebook*. I think making the material chronological, like Kelley, is still beneficial but if it is more interactive people can access material in any order they want. Kelley obviously gives unnecessary material but if we use works of historians like **Herodotus**, we can possibly *simplify* the information by comparing how and if his work is still reflected in history of today. A lot of our discussions have seemed focused on how *current historiography* was shaped or influenced by these *ancient* historians. Maybe if we provide a foundation of what historiography is like today, we can, in a sense, describe how our historiography became **what it is** due to the works of the past.
