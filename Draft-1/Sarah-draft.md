(This is a ***VERY rough*** rough draft - I still need to expand more on most of my paragraphs, and include more about Herodotus, Thucydides, and a few other important people such as Homer, Hesiod, Ptahhotep, and Manetho.)

##Mythistory

###Introduction 

According to Kelley, history emerged from myth, and forced itself into stories and legends until it gained full insight. But when exactly did this happen? Was it during the time of Machiavelli, the well-known Italian Renaissance historian? Or Voltaire, the famous writer and historian during the French Enlightenment era? Or is it still gaining understanding in the current century? This question will probably never attain a definite answer, because it seems that as long as there are people around to record it, the subject of history will forever be changing and gaining wisdom and knowledge by those studying it (Kelley, p. 1).

###What is History?

So, what exactly qualifies as history, then? Arguably, the biggest form of history could actually be myth. A myth or traditional story, by definition, concerns the early history of a group of people, and helps to explain some sort of natural or social occurrence. Another example would be an epic poem, which typically discusses heroic deeds and events that are significant to the culture of the poet. Lists of priests and kings are also important forms of recorded history, because they each kept track of important people in different societies. Finally, the last significant form of history is chronology, which observes the arrangement of events and keeps them all in order by the dates they occurred on. All of these genres became a form of history before the term and concept of "history" even existed (Kelley, p. 3). Something else that Kelley points out is that we are never fully able to see past our own prejudices with either history or myth, but when it comes to "working on myth" or "historicizing," this allows us to remain critical of our work and question the sources we are using. Without our deepest prejudices present in our minds, we wouldn't be able to write history in the clearest way possible (Kelley, p. 1). 

###The Art of Writing History

The art of writing history involves three important factors, scope, method, and purpose. Scope involves subject matter, chronology, geography, and historical evidence that has been passed down through the generations verbally (or written down by scribes), which historians have found worthy/useful to make note of. Method involves the means of gathering the above information and making sense of it/re-writing it, primarily to bring it into the public sphere. Finally, the last important factor is purpose. Purpose involves the value claimed for the study of history, and what would later become known as the philosophy of history, that is, history that takes a more theoretical approach. All three of these aspects can be projected on a small or large scale, and can be intended for local or global usage, depending on the historian and what his/her goals are for their work (Kelley, p. 7).

###The Egyptians

Historians have always attempted to relate human behavior/human nature with its environment, which also includes social and natural contexts that help to locate and distinguish it from other cultures and communities (Kelley, p. 8). The Egyptians supplied many examples of historical inquiry and interpretation for historians over the course of time because they were a society that held a vast interest in the origins of the universe, their gods, genealogies, chronology, victories over their enemies, and the afterlife. The Palermo Stone is one example of their efforts to record their history. The stone contains inscriptions of regnal lists on one of six fragments of a giant slab. Social memory during the time of the Egyptians was embodied in architecture and funeral remains. Pyramids and monuments were used in Egyptian myths to help preserve memories (Kelley, pp. 13-14). 

###The Greeks

Philosophy and science made Greece the starting point for the story of the human condition in time (Kelley, p. 13). Proto-historiographical forms of writing in Greek culture included: Genealogy, a line of descent traced continuously from a specific ancestor. Geography, the study of human activity, including the distribution of populations and resources over time. Ethnography, the scientific description of the customs of different cultures and groups of people, and local history, the study of the patterns and behavior of the people in one’s own community. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks also expressed an interest in chronology. Hellanicus, a contemporary Greek writer, attempted to create a comparative study of the chronologies of the Greeks and barbarian tribes, but was ultimately unable to remove the mythical aspects from his work to make it more historically accurate. Examples of Greek mythology include both myths and teachings about their gods and heroes, the origins and importance of their own rituals and culture, and the nature of the world (Kelley, p. 15). 

###Herodotus

Herodotus, known as the "father of history" and the "father of lies," was a Greek historian who greatly enjoyed recording history by means of story-telling. The fact that he was a little too ambitious with his writings and made up many inaccurate details about different cultures heavily links him to the subject of myth. He was, however, the first historian to systematically collect sources, test the legitimacy of them (to an extent), and arranged his materials into well-constructed narratives/tales. His large-scale historical narrative has managed to survive throughout the centuries (Kelley, pp. 2-6). 

###Thucydides

Thucydides, known as the "second founding father of history," concentrated his efforts on politics and the military. His writings on the Peloponnesian War rejected the story-telling narrative that Herodotus was so fond of, and eventually coined the term the Thucydidean Model, which included eyewitness testimony, personal experience, and observable facts (amongst other things) as a way of recording history. He approached his studies in a more analytical manner, thus allowing his readers to come up with their own conclusions from his works. Thucydides can be see as the first historian who really attempted to distinguish myth from history through his work (Kelley, pp.2-6).  

###Truth

The most essential theme to survive constant changes in language, culture, ideology, and human values is the issue of truth, but what does truth mean? It has always exhibited different natures and histories, but each meaning is somehow always united into one single idea; truth is not a static value, and has its own kind of destiny (Kelley, pp. 10-11). Concluding the truth depends on one’s perspective, and how they interpret the information that is given to them. What one person views as the truth could be another person proof of a lie.  

###Memory

The experience of passing time cannot be captured, except for in language, which unfortunately offers a poor representation of individual memories and knowledge. History is often regarded to as a combination of different memories, but this causes more problems than it solves because memory is selective. For example, a huge problem that historians have to take into consideration is that stories that have been passed down through different generations have been changed multiple times, which makes it much more difficult to distinguish the made up parts from the parts that actually did occur (Kelley, p. 11).
