## Marxist Historians Comment

In the extract by E.P. Thompson, he discussed how **exploitation** came to be part of English labor in the 1830’s.  Thompson 
asserted that the rise of the **Industrial Revolution** and **changing political and cultural traditions** in England initiated a 
**shift** away from paternalism in the work place to exploitation of laborers.  While there is a clear emphasis on the how the
**economy** was a catalyst for this shift, Thompson contends that **politics and culture** played an even larger role.  For 
Thompson as the **working class** rose there was a backlash from the “masters” that set in motion the use of exploitation in 
the work place.  He relies heavily on primary sources in particular a source that was entitled “A Journeyman Cotton Spinner”.

The introductory portion of “Marxist Historians” described Marxist history as **driven by economic relationships and classes**.  
For Marx all of history is movement from ancient society to feudal society to capitalist society and eventually socialist 
society which would come from the working class overthrowing the bourgeoisie (p.35-36).  Economics were the very core of 
Marx’s perception of history.  
	
E.P. Thompson on the other hand was described as a **“cultural Marxist”** meaning he took into account the economic impact on 
history but looked to other factors such as political and cultural shifts (p.39).  The excerpt provided displayed this exact
kind of history.  There was a notable discussion about economic factors that initiated the shift toward exploitation, however 
Thompson as stated above moved on to how political and cultural changes constituted an even larger part of the shift. 

While the description of Thompson’s history characterized his method quite well, it would seem that Thompson **isn’t** really 
a Marxist historian.  The role of economics at least as far as I understand it plays a **very small role**. Thompson’s work 
appears to be concerned with the **cultural and political explanations** in history with a small influence from economics.   
Admittedly there is discussion in E.P. Thompson’s work that **may be** more economic in nature then I understand.  There are 
points he makes that I perceive as a cultural explanation, but I could be convinced that they are more economic in nature.
