In the second chapter of “Re-thinking history” Jenkins offers questions and answers about history that arise from the definition he offered in chapter one. 
“What is the status of truth in the discourses of history?” 
1.	If, according to Jenkins definition, the truth cannot be known why do we continue to search for it?
	The “western tradition” seeks truth because of Plato’s view of absolute knowledge and the role that absolute truth plays in Christianity.
2.	How does the term truth function in the discourses of history? 
	“Truth is always created and never found”. Jenkins argues that historical truths are proposed by those with the power to promote them in order to prevent disorder.
Is there any such thing as an objective history or is history just interpretations?
	Although historians can know dates and locations of what happened as objective history they offer no substance as to the why of history. Jenkins argues that historical interpretation exists on a spectrum between the center and the margins of perceptions and that all history beyond the “facts” must be read as historiography. There is always an assumption of values in the interpretation of history.
What is bias and what are the problems with trying to get rid of it?
	Jenkins argues that there is a perception that finding bias in historical inquiry is deemed important. Empiricist history is the belief that the facts of history can offer historical truths. 
	Jenkins says that any historian examining the facts will interpret them differently. Therefore, even study of the “facts of history” experiences bias based on the views of the individual historian. All “facts” are still interpretations. 
What is empathy; can it be done, how, why and if it cannot be achieved, why does it seem so important to try?
	Jenkins defines empathy as “one has to get into an informed appreciation of the predicaments and viewpoints of people in the past in order to gain real historical understanding.”
	Jenkins says achieving empathy is impossible because the historian cannot know what an historical person was thinking. It is not possible for the historian to remove all of the cultural knowledge that has been learned every day of his life and see the past through different cultural perceptions. 
What are the difference between primary and secondary sources, and between “evidence” and “sources”, what is at stake here?
	Jenkins first argument is that the differentiation between primary and secondary sources stops when a secondary source is used as a primary source. We can use a secondary source as a primary study of a historian and his viewpoints. 
	Primary sources of history do not possess an inherent truth and are interpreted through the subjective lenses of the historian. 
What do you do with those couplets (cause and effect, continuity and change, similarity and difference) and is it possible to do what you are asked to do through using them? 
	Jenkins examines the question of cause and effect. A historian examining the “cause” of any one thing must examine an infinite past, effects, and cultures that effected the “cause” of any situation. Jenkins examines the cause of the French Revolution, how far back and how broad a scope the historian would have to examine is impossible. 
	Therefore, historians study what other historians have decided are the “causes” of an even. Any “cause” is decided from historiography, not from the past
Is history an art or a science?
	Although the study of artifacts can be seen as scientific. Jenkins argues that history is an art in that it is a narrative of the past. 
Jenkins argues that all of these questions point again to the question of the “truth” of the past.  Jenkins argues his point that there is no objective truth in history. Jenkins says that history is the narrative of those in the position to justify that narrative. It is also a means to construct cultural identity.
