      <h2 class="homeheading">Subtitle</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">This website introduces some of the most influential approaches that historians have taken in writing about the past up to Ranke. What is history? What is it for? Who is it for? It addresses various philosophies of history (the underlying assumptions of how we can access and understand the past), as well as various historical interpretive frameworks that have shaped the professional practice of history.</p>

      <h2 class="homeheading">Herodotus, Thucydides, and the Foundation of Historical Methodology</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Institutional history and historical inquiry is often traced back to the oral traditions of the Greek dominated Mediterranean World in which traveling minstrels and poets were the primary vehicle of history before its evolution into a paradigmatic inquisitive practice. Historical tradition in the early Hellenic world consisted of firsthand accounts that were retold across generations. While these nomadic proto-historians were perhaps innumerable, very little of their product survives for obvious reasons.</p>

    <h1 class="homeheading">Providential History</h1>
    <h2 class="homeheading">How Judeo-Christian historiography created a universal history with a providential plan</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Judeo-Christian historiography tried to build a bridge between paganism and Christianity. They wanted to prove that history was a continuum in which God had an ultimate goal in mind. For Judeo-Christian historiography God was the God of History and this history was universal.  </p>

    <h2 class="homeheading">How People Wrote History When God Was In Control</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Myth is defined by having components of the supernatural world. From this jumping off point we see many varieties in myth. My main focus is that of the Judeo-Christian Myths as they affect how the Jews and Christians told history based on the Myths They Believed. Since Jews and Christians believed that God was the supreme creator and master of the universe and therefore history, they wrote with him included in the picture.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Renaissance Historiography</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">How Historical Practice Changed Through the Renaissance</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Historiography in the Renaissance began to develop a humanistic approach, and historical events began to be thought of in a more secular context. However, despite this progress, history continued to be influenced by traditional approaches. Although humanism was an important part of historical writing at the time, many scholars were still influenced heavily by religion, and this influence is apparent in their works. The form of the chronicle, which was so widely used in the Middle Ages, continued to be an important historical tool in the Renaissance. The idea of critical thinking in regards to historical sources began to appear, however, the methodology and traditional ways of thinking about the structure of history were not yet viewed critically.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Reforming History</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">The Impact of the Reformation of the Broader Profession of History</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">This chapter aims to highlight the key themes and people of the reformation, as well as show how these themes and the profession of history itself differs from previous eras and impacts the subsequent. An appropriate place to start any story is to begin with the origins and agendas, move onto the actual period and finally end with how history was regarded along with the duality of history in the Reformation.</p>
