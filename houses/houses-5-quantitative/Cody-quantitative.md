The chapter on quantitative history examines the value of history by numbers.  Basically, this method involves attaching a number to everything, and making everything into a statistic.  There is some degree of merit to this approach, in that it deals with hard data, and is therefore less subjective to bias.  It can also be used to show the connections between one set of data and another.  The author uses several examples of this, such as the effects of the weather on a countryâ€™s economy, or a rise in levels of theft as a reflection of poverty and/or a decrease in the availability of supplies.  While this methodology certainly has its uses, correlations can sometimes exist, without any certainty of cause-and-effect.  A presidential election, for instance, can coincide with the onset of a drought, but that does not mean that the new president was responsible for said drought.  And, as with all history, one must consider the source of the data for its reliability and accuracy.  Quantitative history, however, is less subjective to bias and political agenda than the conventional approach.
