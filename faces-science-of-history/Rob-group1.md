   -Science of History-

- The Renaissance idea of history, particularly within the context of humanist education was, "a literal imitation and elaboration of what the ancients had professed," with its aim being, "to gather many ages into one view." p189

- History was still looked at as an art and criticized for dishonesty, "Herodotus is called the father of history, [Juan Luis] Vives recalled, but to some he was also the father of lies." p190

- Jean Bodin thought history was not just above the arts, but science as well. Bodin was also a pioneer in his belief that, "History was, precisely like the law, of three sorts--human, natural and divine." p197-198

- Lenglet du Fresnoy, a disciple of Jean Bodin, defined his, "new method of history" as such, "To study history is to study the motives, opinions and passions of men...to know all the delusions they put upon our intellects...in one word to know ones self by others." p193

- The term critic began in the 16th century medical field before moving into literal and philosophical criticism, ultimately contributing to a rise historical criticism. p 205 

- The methodologies developed, codified and refined during the Renaissance contributed to the emergence of a new way of writing about history, "the conjunction of these impulses with archaeology and anthropology in a modern sense marked the beginning of an enlightened and truly (if in some cases excessively speculative) philosophical history." p216
