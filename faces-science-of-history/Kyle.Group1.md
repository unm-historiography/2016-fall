1. History gains its place amongst the humanities. "History holds **first place**, wrote Brumi, for "knowledge of the past gives guidance to our counsels and our practical judgement"".(Pg 189) We see impartiality become a **core focus for historians**, "Only history reached "perfection" under the influence of rhetoric and the rule of *Ciceronian laws of truth* and *impartiality*.(Pg 190)
2. History began to find a method of doing history, the modern foundations of history were in the sixteenth century. "History became... a science because it was organized according to a *systemic method*"(Pg 193)
3. The **codification** of history. "Beginning with a comprehensive, classified list of histories and the proper order of reading them, and with the methodilogical structuring of the knowledge produced by such reading"(Pg 198) 
4. Bodin's method is an example of historiography taking its modern form. 
  1. "Bodin's primary concern was with **truth** and **impartiality**"(Pg 199)
  2. "Political analysis in the style of Thucydides was essential to an understanding of history in terms of:"the *causes of things*,*the origins*, the progresses,*the inclinations*, all the plans of everyone"" (Pg 199)
  3. "The Universal interests of Herodotus":"The **critical understanding** of...inherited myths of universal history.", The "**refutation** of the old four monarchy thesis" and "the idea of a golden age, which went against the *testimonies of all the ancient historians*", "The **question** of the origins of people". (Pgs 199 & 200) 
  4. Bodin urged the study of *geography* and *language* to find the origins of man, a **secular approach**.
5. The question of origins is what drove the study of antiquity. "History has from the beginning shown a drive toward questions of origins... history has a **human dimension**". "In the sixteenth century **historical criticism** was already at work eliminating myths of origins" 
6. "**Historical Criticism** reached a peak in the nineteenth century, but it had much deeper roots... the philology of the Renaissance"(Pg 205) 
7. We see a greater emphasis on source material. "For Bayle, the **proper method** was fundamentally that of the humanist call for the rejection of tradition in favor of a return to the "**sources** rather than streams,""(Pg 207)
