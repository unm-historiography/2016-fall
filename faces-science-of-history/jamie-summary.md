Kelley touches on three major points regarding the art, method, and criticism of history in this chapter.

1. The “art” of history is a game of tug-of-war, with **rhetoric and style** on one side and **utility and truth** on the other, and is problematic in that **history retains “poetic” qualities**.
   * Agrippa complains that it is “impossible” that historiographers are not in some way liars (191)

2. The “correct” method of creating history is still highly debatable in this period, and **each historian has their own preferred sources** (eyewitness accounts, records, archaeology).
   * We are simultaneously **spectators, interpreters, and actors, which complicates our understanding and writing history** (194)
   * Historians are still **politically motivated** – perhaps even more so, with writers like Francis Bacon working in service of the king

3. Historical criticism in this period is chiefly concerned with **uncovering forgeries** and **upholding accuracy of truth in history**
