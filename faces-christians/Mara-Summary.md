1.Education of the human race was seen movement *towards* heavenly and invisible things.  Christian and Jewish historians alike
were looking for the education of the human race or “higher spiritual meaning” as means of explaining history. (p.75)
2.Jewish historian Josephus was devoted to the truth and his nation in his pursuit of history.  Additionally he actively 
defended his work while attacking other historians for not achieving the truth or devotion to the nation. (p.78)
  1.seems to be a combination of Roman historians *(confronting other historians)* and earlier Greek historians 
  *(seeking out the truth)*
3.Christian history was to some extent hindered by the conflicting past (paganism) and present of the religion. (p.84)
  1.connects back to our discussion of beginnings and their importance to history i.e. how does this conflict between past 
  and present alter the writing of Christian history?
  2.Eusebius statement “Are we Greeks or Barbarians” seems to connect to this idea of a confused/conflicting origin (p.86)
4.Eusebius was not concerned with stylistic or formal considerations, rather he was focused on *reinforcing* the “grand design 
of God”. (p.88) Christian historians of this time were “Bound to Biblical authority” (p.89)
  1.similar to both the influence Greek mythology and the city of Rome had on history during their respective times
  2.different however because Eusebius was **not** trying to discover truth instead his task was essentially to put things in 
  the right order (p.88)
5.All historical works have a *“textual exegesis”*. (p.95)  The Christian exegesis (which seems to refer to interpretation of 
evidence) was marked by the task of harmonizing the secular with Christian texts. (p.96)  More generally this means that each 
faction or school of history is writing history based out of their own *“textual exegesis”*.
  1.seems to link to the influence of bias on history that we talked about in the beginning
