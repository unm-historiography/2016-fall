* History was neglected and minimalized, at least in the early medeieval period, as it dealt with "temporal" instead of "eternal" or "Perpetual" discourses. However it was given importance in relating the Mundane and Spiritual, and providing medeival individuals with moral and instructory tales. (102)

* Much of medeival writing was created to relate a form of blossoming national identity for the formerly "Barbarian" kingdoms to the "Truth" of Christianity. Many of the "First historians of Europe" exemplify this trend; Gregory of Tours frames the martial valor of the Frankish kings against gaining gods favor, for instance (109). 

* Chronicle writing evolved as a form of related historical endeavor to "histories"; in the context of our class, chronicles claim to report facts, while histories impart meaningful analysis of these facts (120). However these lines were progressively blurred. 

* Many of the trends of historical scholarship can be seen emerging; the idea of the "primary source" can be seen if not explicitly invoked in the idea of "Opsis" (122), for instance. 

* In general, histories of this time are defined by the interaction of religious "truths" and more mundane events, primarily the emergency of proto-nations in the overwhelming context of the Christian paradigm.
