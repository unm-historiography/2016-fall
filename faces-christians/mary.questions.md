On page 81 Kelley talks about the idea of truth from the perspective of the bible. He says “most often truth is the word and law of god.” He describes history as “human “fables,” ” traditions,” and “philosophy”. From this perspective can “truth”, for the Christian, exist apart from the word and laws of god?

Kelley says that “the story of early Christianity-centers on the question of how to make sense of the past, even if it meant composing meaning.” (84)  Pagan histories were interpreted by Christianity as the “preparation for the gospel.” (84). Do you think that every new civilization or culture appropriates or “assigns meaning” to the past to legitimize its own beliefs and world views?

Kelley’s discussion of Christian historians is the first time that we have seen a discussion of time and chronology aside from “the past”.  Kelley mentions the idea that, outside of human consciousness, no time other than the present moment exists. Does the focus on a future redemption enhance the importance of chronology or time in history?  Do you think that cultures in which redemption is possible in the present moment put less emphasis on chronology?
