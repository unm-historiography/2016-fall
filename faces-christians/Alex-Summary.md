• In Judeo-Christian thought, history is more than the things that took place in the past. It is a construct for looking back to human origins and forward to our impending judgement and transcendence. A tool to give meaning to human existence. (p.75) Texts (Homeric, Herodotean, Thucidydean, Mosaic, etc) dominated the practice of examining human culture as a “textbook of culture” (p.76) through analysis of history, theology, philosophy, science, law, and politics.

• All cultures have conceived some sort of “mythology” surrounding and “original lawgiver” (p.79) in order to reconcile history and philosophy (mythology). Clement of Alexandria wrote that “philosophy is all that is rightly said in the [Stoic, Platonic, Epicurean, Aristotelean] schools of thought.” (p.81)

• Chronology is one of the central problems of the human tradition. (Conceived originally to establish the date of the birth of Christ) but became a tool to establish peoples and cultures places in a broader human narrative. (p.82-83) (again examining the issues of human origin and transcendence)

• The “story” of Christianity is a step in the evolution/ “progression of empires” and mankind’s ongoing literary attempt to make sense of the past. (p.85) Part of a larger “historical continuum” (p.86)

• Chronology is not the central theme of historical interpretation but it does hold significance for the sake of establishing causal relationships between people and events and vice-versa. (p.89-91)

• Interpretation is a tool for making sense of written texts, spiritual and secular, literal and allegorical; and for giving them context and historical significance. (p.96)
