•	Can it be argued that, in some sense, "history" began with Christianity, since years have been numerically counted since the birth of Christ?

•	According to Tatian, both history and philospohy were invented by Egyptians, Babylonians, and Jews, and then stolen by the Greeks. (p.82) Does/should  this discredit the likes of Herodotus and Thucydides as pioneers of history?

•	Can Eusebius be credited as having separated history from myth with his History of the Church, or did he actually meld them together by “fixing an accurate chronology for the scriptural canon” (p.87)?
