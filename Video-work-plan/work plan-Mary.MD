Let me begin by thanking Dr. Gibbs for requiring a work plan. I think this is going to help me stay organized and on track. I am excited for this project and I know in the end I will wish I had spent more time on it
The book I have chosen to review is “Histories of the Holocaust” by Dan Stone. I have not read the book yet, so that is first. It is a 300-page book and should take about one week to read if I read slowly and critically. I will take careful notes while I am reading about how best to communicate this message through a video platform.  I will have completed reading the book by Saturday November 19th.
I will download Camtasia on November 18th. Because I tend to geek out new technology I could waste hours playing with it.
