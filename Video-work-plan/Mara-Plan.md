### Video Work Plan

Nov. 14th-18th (basically when I have time): Read the Book  
Nov. 19th (4 hrs): Finish Reading by this Date and Outline Review
Nov. 20th (2 hrs): Work w/ Software (learn how to edit, do voice stuff) and Plan the Design of the Video (find pictures to use)
Nov. 21st (2 hrs): Make Detailed Notes About Review (this is where Iâ€™ll decide the particulars based off of the vague outline I make on the 19th) and Begin to Write the Script (I think this will be more like notes rather than a word by word script, but we'll seen what I end up needing when I am making the video)
Nov. 22nd (2 hrs): Finish Script 
Nov. 23rd (2 hrs): Time Script and then Edit Script 
Nov. 27th (basically as long as it takes, not too sure how long it will take): Put Together a Very Rough Draft of the Video 

**Everything is subject to change depending on if I need more time.  I am not really sure how long it will take me to get comfortable with the software, but I am hoping no longer then an hour or so.**
