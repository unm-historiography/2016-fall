November 14th-19th-Re-read Refiguring History as many times as it takes to fully grasp what he is trying to say. As well as look into fixing my phone (my only real camera capable of video beside the webcam on my laptop) in a stationary postion to make the filming of the time-lapse portions easier. Buy a suitably sized puzzle and figure out exactly how I want the video to look.
