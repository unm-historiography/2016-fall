# Video Work Plan

##### Purpose
Create a video book review that not only summarizes *The Darker Side of the Renaissance*, but goes more in-depth. 

##### Intro
Help whoever views my review understand my book, without having to read boring reports and summaries.

##### Objectives and Goals
The goal is to give others a solid understanding of *The Darker Side of the Renaissance*.  My objectives are to make the viewer more interested in the material, teach students how to analyze a book, and also to practice a form of communication I've never used before.

#####Achievability
I have fourteen days to complete the project.  I need to read thirty three pages per day in order to finish the book (with two days to spare).  Throughout the next two weeks I will be filling in my outline on top of reading.
