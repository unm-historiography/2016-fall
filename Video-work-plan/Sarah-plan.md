I decided to switch books for this project because the original book I had wanted to use didn't fully fit into the cateogry of historiography, but I think the new one I have will be great. It's a 230 page book which is less than the original one I picked, but it'll still take me several days to completely finish. Hopefully I can stick to this schedule, and even get things done sooner than what the dates on here say, but we shall see.

###Schedule

*Monday, November 14th*: Read book + take detailed notes

*Monday, November 21s*t: Start on making the slideshow into an actual video (hopefully I will feel confident with this part after playing around with Camtasia)

*Tuesday, November 22nd*: Start working on the voiceover part of the video...do a few tests beforehand to see what my weird quirks are
