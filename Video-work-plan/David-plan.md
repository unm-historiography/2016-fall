I wonder if I did this right?

November 14/15: Complete reading of all books (Historiae Mundi, The idea of universal history from Hellinistic [sic] philosophy to early Christian historiography) and choose, definitively, which one to use as basis for project (Historiae Mundi?). 

Basis for decision:

Historiae Mundi has different authors, telling different stories.

“The idea of…” Is a more single narrative/longer story, but is often dry and not terribly well written. Also, hasn’t arrived yet in print and online version has Issues. Might not be as insightful. 

So it depends on if a potentially bad book, or a book with different authors and disjointed narrative, would be more useful/plausible to critique. 

November 16/17: Do preliminary research into determining what “story” to tell. 

With Historiae Mundi it will most likely be that the book is disjointed (ironically not telling a “united history” of Universal history) and has different definitions, themes, and plotlines, which the reader needs to be cognizant of, however it also does a decent job of branching off from the “major” authors and perspectives…With *some* essays. Entirely different purpose than a regular book.

With The Idea of…it will most likely be more centered on a traditional critique of his point and narrative.

November 19/20/21: Find pictures that might be useful, determine major software to use, make minor progress, etc.

(Find pictures of old maps, major authors, and any other way of representing historically relevant “worldviews”)

November 22: Familiarize myself with the particular software (but I’ve done this before, so…)

November 23-26: Do nothing productive.

November 27: Tally how little I have actually done, Panic, then make something up and record it at the last possible second.

November 28: Tear out hair.

No, but honestly, I’ll need to see how the first part goes. Real plan is to spend time after the 22nd doing test narrations (I always just jump in), and to ideally finish recording on the 26th.

Plan Goals: pictures and such should supplement the narration. I prefer a blend of pictures and narration, interplaying with each other, but will need to cut down on how to make my point without having it sounding insane. 

Plan plausibility: Well, the part after the 22nd is probably pretty accurate XD
