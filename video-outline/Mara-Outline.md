## Video Book Review: Johann Sledian and the Protestant Vision of History
1. So first I am **briefly** going to describe each chapter
   1. I plan to spend more time on the more historiographically relevant chapters which appear to be Chapter 5, 6, and 7
   2. However the others chapters provide good **background information** regarding why Sledian became the historiographer           for the Protestant Reformation.  Those chapters say a lot about the **motivations** of the Protestant leaders and the         perception they desired.
2. From there I’ll move into any possible **bias** the author may have and also highlight the **strengths** of her work.
   1. Purely based on the Introduction, it is clear that Kass thinks Sledian is **more important** than the amount of work           done on him would suggest.  Here is a place in which bias could impact how Kass frames Sledian’s impact and                   significance.  
   2. The book does appear to be quite comprehensive in that the book covers how Sledian became the historiographer for the         Reformation, the context in which he was chosen, and then moves on to his work and reception (it is short so there must       be details that were neglected) 
   3. Kass also seems to frame the goals of Protestant historiography in a honest light.  That is to say that she doesn’t seem       to be masking any motivations that could be seen negatively.  
3. **How in the world does one make this into a video?**
   1. To be really honest, I’m not sure.  This video stuff is way out of my range of skills, so I am kinda shooting into the         dark.
   2. I’ve thought about doing a **prezi** (because they are super cool) were the video is a kind of road that goes from point       to point (does that make any sense at all?), but I’m not sure I can do a voice thing with a prezi.  I suppose I could         also do a video like the ones on the **syllabus** which might be easier and make more sense.  
   3. I want to use pictures of Protestant churches, Sledian, maybe of Sledian’s original work, and other stuff in that             strain.  I think its really important to actually see the stuff your hearing about, so I want to make sure I only use         stuff that is mentioned in the text.
      * also I'm not sure how I feel about using animations at all. I don't really like them
   4. That is really all I have for now which I know is super basic.  I’m still trying to understand what I can do and figure       out what I want to do.
