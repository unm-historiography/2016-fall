Video Outline of “Understanding Comics”

- What a comic book is
 
   -  Over view of comic books.
   -  How a comic book uses the space.
   -  Understanding time (Ch 4).

- Vocabulary in comics
 
   -  Talking about Language and how it is used to tell the story (Ch. 2)
   -  Viewing emotion as a background (Ch. 5). Non-verbal communication.
   -  Lines mean different thinks.
   
- The visual aids

   - The use of color. Expressing light and dark (Ch. 8).
   - Bringing the comic book together to tell the whole story (Ch. 9).
   - Mouse and Persepolis.

My idea is to use the book itself and other examples to show history. The video will most likely be a PowerPoint with voice, or a video of me holding the book and talking about it (I don’t know about that one). The point is to show pictures and talk about why comics are important.
