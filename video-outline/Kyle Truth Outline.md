1. **Introduction and Synopsis** 
    1. of the book "*Truth & History*" by **Murray G. Murphy**. Explain the book's publication and explain who the historian is behind the book. (Images of the book, historian, and the university he is from) 

2. **The Strengths of the Book**: 
 
    1. The writing clarity of the book, and the explanation of jargon and technical terms. His writing is not too flowery or academic, and it has a flow that doesn't get bogged down in its own inflation of self worth, like most academic writings tend to do. 
    2. The clear structure of the book with excellent descriptions of what is within each said chapter and the reason for why that chapter was written . 
    3. The explanation of the philosophy behind the argument and the explanation of the position from a philosophical position. 
    4. The works cited are seperated by chapter, and it makes looking at the sources streamlined. 
    5. Numbered lists, easy to read and understand. Doesn't use blocky within text lists like most historians, and again keeps the writing streamlined. 
    6. Brings in primary source text within the writing. 
    7. Recently published, in 2009. More modern and within this century. 
3.  **The Weaknesses of the Book**: (image of academics and a university) 
     1. Too streamlined, not academic jargon heavy. Easy target for other academics with more flowery and technical writing style. 
     2. Thin book, not too long. Again, other academics will attack the book for being too easy a read, and too streamlined. 
     3. Might seem too philosophical for some historians with no philosophy background.
4. **Scholarly Value**: (Image of stacks of books) 
   1. Bridges the gap between philosophy and history. Allows for an audit of history from philosophical viewpoint. 
   2. Asks questions about the very nature of evidence, and brings an empirical audit of history as well. 
   3. Murray G. Murphey is a Professor Emiritus at the State University of New York, so is an expert in the field. 
5. **Relation within history**:
   1. Constructive Realist, and offers clarification of complex truth issues found within the truth of history. 
   2. Again, gives an empirical argument for the truth in historiography, and the nature of the evidence used by historians.
