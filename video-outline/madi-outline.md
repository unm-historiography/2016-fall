## Video Book Review Outline


###The Race of Time: three lectures on Renaissance Historiography - Herschel Baker


 * Going to briefly discuss the organisation of the book (visually could represent as a mind map)
  * Organised by theme
    * Truth, Use, and Form
    * Easy to navigate when looking for something within one of those themes, not set up well for looking for people or events (not chronological, even within the chapters).
  * sections within chapter
    * addresses sub-themes or categories within the context of the larger idea of the chapter, helps with navigation in the absence of chronology.


 * Some of the weaknesses of the book
  * similar to Kelley, Baker drops a lot of names, most of which don’t seem particularly significant.  Doesn’t spend much time on most of them.
  * use of quotation: over quotes, and uses small, choppy quotes - pulling out individual words at times.  Not within context of original work.
  * Seems to discuss general concerns of historiography more than the specifics of Renaissance historiography
    * Uses specific Renaissance historians and their works as examples, but much of what is discussed could apply to any time period to some extent.
  

 * Historiographical Issues addressed
  * Truth (essential but futile)
  * Bias
    * those who acknowledge their influences vs those who don’t
    * instances of the author’s bias (ex: pg 79)
  * Form (i.e. methodology & concern with sources)
    * criticism of research methods
    * use of primary sources
