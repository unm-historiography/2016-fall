The annals school began in 1929. It has changed focus many times from a focus on social science to a focus on geology to a focus on mentalities. 

The annals school sought to move beyond historical examination of politics and military to include all aspects of human sciences to the study of history.  They believed that all aspects of society were important to historical investigation. 

The annals school was begun by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloc. Fabvre studies the effects of geography on all aspects of society. Bloc included climate in histories as well as analyzing “relationship, customs, and rituals.” They both examined views and beliefs on history.

There was a focus on a “total history” which is not only impossible but of no use. What is the purpose of knowing everything about history? Is it not more important to focus on historical events from which we can learn something about ourselves? 

The annals school also focused more on quantitative examinations of history than qualitative. Data is studied as a historical tool.  

In the 1970’s the Annales school shifted focus and became concerned with Mentalities.  They sought to understand a society through shared beliefs and attitudes. This is the most interesting idea to come out of the Annales school. It could be very useful in understanding what happened in each society to know what their shared mind-sets and values were. 

An Annales historian Braudel, explained time a multi-layered scheme with each layer moving at a different speed. Braudel’s concepts of time were indeed new in the study of history and incredibly imaginative. His histories appear to involve geologic changes with little or no discussion of human activities. This is an interesting concept to consider.  I can see his concept of geographic time moving so slowly as to be imperceptible, however I do not see how this is relevant to the study of history.

Braudel’s writing means nothing. He simply puts for a lot of observations about how he sees things. He says that people who live in the mountains are fundamentally different. He makes obscure observations about geology and what trees grow where. “There are also walnut trees in the mountains”, Braudel states as though this is an important fact or gives some perspective on what life in the mountains is like. I suppose that this reading, for me, speaks to the question of what is the value of historical scholarship?  The study of history can, on some level be a bland retelling of things that have been. However, for me history must speak to something deeper and more meaning. What deeper and more meaningful. That I do not know yet. Perhaps I need to feel that it helps me to understand my own existence in some small way. Reading this I felt that I learned nothing of value. Except, perhaps that I am not a fan of the Annles school.
