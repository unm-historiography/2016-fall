Annales historians were largely concerned with **breaking down** the barriers between the “human sciences”.   They wanted to 
incorporate as many disciplines as possible in their work in order to achieve what was sometimes called **“total history”**.  
Annales first grew out of an rejection of purely political history.  For Annales historians the **interaction** between 
culture and political history for example was much more interesting and more complete.  Braudel an Annales historian once said 
“the history of the Mediterranean ‘can more be separated from that of the lands surrounding it than the clay can be separated
from the hands of the potter who shapes it’” (p. 90).  That is to say you can’t separate one part of history from all its
other parts.  Annales also introduced the idea of **mentalités** which was essentially the study of everyday people and how 
they impacted and were impacted by history.  
	
Fernand Braudel’s piece about the history of the Mediterranean follows quite closely with the description of Annales
history.  He was concerned with all the **integral parts** of history such as the geography of the land, migration of people, 
economy, and resources.  Braudel disscused how the mountains in the region created a physical barrier between the various 
groups living in the area, and how when the physical barrier inadequately separated people there was a social and culture 
barrier that maintain the boundaries.  However people living in the Mediterranean region were inexplicably connected by 
economics and resources despite the physical and social barriers in place. 
	
Braudel’s history had the advantage of being quite complete in the sense that he looked at history though **multiple lenses**. 
All of the various parts of the history are connected in a logical manner that tells a story **i.e.** what he is saying is 
digestible.  However as was pointed out in Houses his work is "suspiciously" **lacking people**.  He talks a lot about people
and their interactions, but there aren’t really any sources that come from the people.  The “peoples” voice seems lost in 
all the discussion of mountains and landscape.  This seems a little **contradictory** with the idea of mentalités which sought 
out the experience of everyday people. Without some kind of source from everyday people, how can you truly ascertain what 
their experience was like?   Of course there may not be a lot of primary sources for the peoples he was studying, however 
the complete lack of those sources or the discussion of their absence appears contrary to parts of Annales history.
