Renaissance historiography began with the **"rediscovery"** of ancient historians such as Thucydides (p.136). These
historians went back to the ancients in order to develop means of studying history.  While historians of the Middle Ages were
not completely ignored, the focus of Renaissance historians appeared to be on earlier Roman or Greek historians.  As Petrarch
said **“What is all history but the praise of Rome?”** (p.130).  Renaissance historiography also followed in the tradition of
Thucydides and focused on military and political history, however their history was marked by Renaissance humanism (p.140-141). 

During the Renaissance unlike anytime before, people saw the future as better than the present and present as better than
the past.  This invariably marked the motivation for historians of the time.  They saw their work as a tool **future
generations** could utilized to further the prosperity of a nation (p.137).  While the focus on the past was certainly
present in Renaissance historiography, there was a sense that their work could and would **benefit** people in the future 
which is seemingly a new conviction.  Another key extension of this idea, was the continuance of the barbarian Middle Ages. 
Again as stated earlier, Renaissance historians thought more of Roman historians then any others (p.147).

One other notable characteristic of Renaissance historiography, was the the **elevated status** of history as a profession.
Georges Chastellain was even given an official appointment in historiography in 1455 (p.142).  Chastellain even said that it
was the nature of some men to “observe and understand the variable things of this world” (p.142).  The existence of any kind
of official appointment involving history alone is a fairly significant change from the past.  Prior as we have seen
historians were not put in high regard, but here during the Renaissance historians gained official appointments and even
princes were advised to read history (p.146)
