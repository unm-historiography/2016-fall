This chapter, perhaps (unbelievably) more than others, can be hard to parse in terms of the themes we've been discussing.

- As established last time, we know that historiography is constantly changing and being repurposed to suit particular needs; so how specifically is that happening here? What elements of historiography have strong historical precedents? Which are being transformed?
- Politics is obviously important in this chapter. HOW SO? Of course history is being used to reaffrim power as we've seen in many other contexts. But what's different?
- How did the "discovery" of the New World, and the cultural differences it highlights, affect historiography---especially considering all of the barbarian histories we discussed last time? Anything new?
