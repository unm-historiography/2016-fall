1. There was a strong need within large cities to begin keeping records for *administrative*, *commercial*, *ideological*, and *political* purposes (p. 136).
More and more people began writing down things that were happening around them and **keeping track** of important events in their lives and the lives of others.

2. The study of history was the key to the success of *political science*, and creating important and modernistic policies (p. 147).
The political sphere would greatly **benefit** from the study of history because it would allow for **comparisons** between ancient and modern times. 

3. After a while, the conventional view of history (pertaining to politics and military actions) shifted to a more *humanist view*, including the arts and sciences that are associated with humanist learning (p. 152).
Scholars were beginning to use history to **study** and **learn** new subject matter to better understand the humanities and more humanistic ways of thinking, rather than sticking to strictly religious views and explanations. 

4. History was also used during the Renaissance period to further understand and expand *civil law* (p. 153).
This allowed scholars to draw a direct line between ancient and modern cultures, and **compare** and **contrast** prior successes and failures.

5. After the discovery of the New World, the main question for historians was how all this new land (that had unknown native peoples with unknown histories) could possibly fit into the old methods of historiography (p. 156).
Historians had to adapt their previous methods to match their new experiences and discoveries, therefore **mixing** old and new together to form updated histories.

6. “America was not so much *discovered* as it was *invented*” (p. 161).
Much of what proceeded to happen in the New World was based off of **old concepts** of religion, law, politics, etc.
