###During the medeival period the debate about histpry contines in much the same way it has for cunturies. Although the esteem of history seems low during this time, debates about *truth, identity, and power continue. We see the beginings of a nationalism, the continues effect of religion and debate about what form of history is closer to the *truth. 
###Kelley says that history in medievel times still expounded the importace of *truth in the discourse of history. However history changed when viewed through the lense of Christianity, "reinterprested in the context of Christian faith, piety, doctorine, and the different attitudes toward what was "worth remembering.""(100)
  This is once again an example of a culture appropriating history to tell the story that is important within that culture. 
###During the medieval period we beging to see "national" histories. 
  Histories and common narratives begin to emerge from what will become England, France, Germany and Spain.
  Kelley says that distinct cultures are coallesing in the areas and that historians played a large part in the formation of "national" identity.
###Chronicle is a chronological list of events, while history is a narrtive about past events.
  Clerical chronicals are "disconnected and undiscriminating record of human, natural and divine phenomena." (119)
  Aristocratic chronicals "featured moral and political judgements" (119)
  The debate then becomes that although chronicals may be more *"truthful" are they more or less usefull than histories from which we can derive meaning. 
  "Although some critics might regard the simple chronical as inferior to more elegant historical narrative, scientific minded historians...regarded chronicals as closer to the aim of *truth telling." (121)
### We can see the effects of religion from histories of the cusades. 
  "they were in part a form of propoganda;and thier view was limited." (122)
