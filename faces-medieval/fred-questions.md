- How should we characterize the medieval conception of history?
- What constituted true history for medievals? Did place matter? Were some histories truer than others?
- What is the nature of truth? (just kidding)
- Seriously though, where did the idea of historical truth come into play in the reading for today?
- Relatedly, what is significance of the history/chronical distinction?
