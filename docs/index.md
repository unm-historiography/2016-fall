      <h2 class="homeheading">Subtitle</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">This website introduces some of the most influential approaches that historians have taken in writing about the past up to Ranke. What is history? What is it for? Who is it for? It addresses various philosophies of history (the underlying assumptions of how we can access and understand the past), as well as various historical interpretive frameworks that have shaped the professional practice of history.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Myth and History</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">How History Emerged from Myth</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">According to Kelley, history emerged from myth, and forced itself into stories and legends until it gained full insight (Kelley, p. 1). But when exactly did this happen? Was it during the time of Machiavelli, the well-known Italian Renaissance historian? Or Voltaire, the famous writer and historian during the French Enlightenment era? Or is it still gaining understanding in the current century? This question will probably never attain a definite answer. As long as there are people around to record it, the subject of history will forever be changing and gaining wisdom and knowledge by those studying it (Kelley, p. 1).</p>

      <h2 class="homeheading">Herodotus, Thucydides, and the Foundation of Historical Methodology</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Institutional history and historical inquiry is often traced back to the oral traditions of the Greek dominated Mediterranean World in which traveling minstrels and poets were the primary vehicle of history before its evolution into a paradigmatic inquisitive practice. Historical tradition in the early Hellenic world consisted of firsthand accounts that were retold across generations. While these nomadic proto-historians were perhaps innumerable, very little of their product survives for obvious reasons.</p>

    <h1 class="homeheading">Providential History</h1>
    <h2 class="homeheading">How Judeo-Christian historiography created a universal history with a providential plan</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Judeo-Christian historiography tried to build a bridge between paganism and Christianity. They wanted to prove that history was a continuum in which God had an ultimate goal in mind. For Judeo-Christian historiography God was the God of History and this history was universal.  </p>

    <h2 class="homeheading">How People Wrote History When God Was In Control</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">Myth is defined by having components of the supernatural world. From this jumping off point we see many varieties in myth. My main focus is that of the Judeo-Christian Myths as they affect how the Jews and Christians told history based on the Myths They Believed. Since Jews and Christians believed that God was the supreme creator and master of the universe and therefore history, they wrote with him included in the picture.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Renaissance Historiography</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">How Historical Practice Changed Through the Renaissance</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Historiography in the Renaissance began to develop a humanistic approach, and historical events began to be thought of in a more secular context. However, despite this progress, history continued to be influenced by traditional approaches. Although humanism was an important part of historical writing at the time, many scholars were still influenced heavily by religion, and this influence is apparent in their works. The form of the chronicle, which was so widely used in the Middle Ages, continued to be an important historical tool in the Renaissance. The idea of critical thinking in regards to historical sources began to appear, however, the methodology and traditional ways of thinking about the structure of history were not yet viewed critically.</p>

      <h2 class="homeheading">The Impact of the Reformation of the Broader Profession of History</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">This chapter aims to highlight the key themes and people of the reformation, as well as show how these themes and the profession of history itself differs from previous eras and impacts the subsequent. An appropriate place to start any story is to begin with the origins and agendas, move onto the actual period and finally end with how history was regarded along with the duality of history in the Reformation.</p>

      <h2 class="homeheading">The Narrative and Dialogue of Historiography During the Enlightenment</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">The Enlightenment witnessed thinkers who used reason to critique the established structures of society. This criticism was also applied to the study of history. History of the Enlightenment cannot be understood without a fundamental understanding of philosophical concepts of the time. In this article Enlightenment thought and its effect on the study of history are examined.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Historical Methods and Truth</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">Defining Truth: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">From the scrolls of ancient Greece to the jargon packed books of the modern academic historian, historians have searched for “true histories”. In studying what constitutes history, we must focus on some themes that belong to what we call today historiography. Historiography focuses on these themes that form this modern academic discipline: Source criticism, fact vs. truth, impartiality, scholarship, critical understanding, and secularism. From ancient times to the modern day, what constitutes the “truth” has changed significantly, and historians have been critical to that change.</p>

      <h1 class="homeheading">Histories for Everyone</h1>
      <h2 class="homeheading">The Varied and Deep Tradition of Universal History</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Universal histories, at their most fundamental level, detail histories which attempt to transcend particulars, the local and the singular, to form a narrative which applies to all the world’s peoples. It is important to note two words there; the attempt and the transcendence. Universal histories seek to escape the particulars of the society which creates them, to transcend the particulars and spread a larger message. This attempt to create a universal history is impossible. Universal Histories often fail in their goals, fall flat on further analysis, or are significantly limited in scope. They make assumptions or generalizations, based on perceived trends, religious expectations, or philosophical musings, that can never be utterly “correct”. Thus, in modern scholarship, we see an abandonment of these ancient traditions and narratives for more limited, small scale, historical analysis. I urge the reader, as an aside, to contrast the modern historical field with the varied and deep traditions of the past, and see how the ancients created rich, flawed, and fascinating narratives which sought to expand their horizons.</p>
