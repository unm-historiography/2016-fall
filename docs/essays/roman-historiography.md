# The Romans

## The Model for the Ages

This is looking at the Romans and the historians that helped shaped the path for the many areas that followed. Looking at Livy, Cicero, and Tacitus and their methods and why they are important to history.

###Introduction

The Romans are important to history because they were the model for the different eras that followed them. The Roman Empire produced two of the major historians with Livy and the rise of the empire and Tacitus with the fall of the empire. Livy and his writings would become the groundwork for many historians to come. Rhetoric was very important because it was used to get the people of Rome to follow Caesar and the Senate. Roman rhetoric would become the standard for all governments throughout the course of history.

###Before Rome

The Greeks came before the Romans and used a different method to tell their history. The method was to pass down to each generation to keep the history alive by telling stories and writing poems about important events. Herodotus, one of the fathers of history who was also known as the “gift of Hera” (Kelly, pg. 19) was a Greek historian. Herodotus was a major traveler, which performed interviews with people about events, and then turns those into poems and mighty stories to tell. An example of this would be when Herodotus talked about the Peloponnesian wars. The key difference from Greek and Roman historians is that the Greek take the individual stories and events to make them their own, and the Romans wrote their lives and used individual stories to tell about events. This leads to Livy and how he wrote about Roman history.

###Livy

Livy was the major historian for the Rise of Rome. Livy wrote history during the monarchy and the new republic. This was important because the history changed in front of Livy’s eyes, and he wrote about it because it was an important event. Livy’s method was to use his own life experiences, customs, culture, correspondences, and “military actions” (Kelly, pg.56). Livy told his stories and wrote so well that in the Renaissance era historians look back to his work and use his methods as the reference to future work. Kelly tells us that Petrarch “bought a copy of Livy’s history,” which he referenced in his own work called “Africa” (Kelly, pg. 132).

###Early Roman History

The start of the Roman republic was with the overthrow of the monarchy and with the city. Livy who is considered one of the founder fathers of history and along with all other Romans agreed that their history started with the formation of Rome. Livy watched parts of Rome being built. The reason for this is that Romans measure time with the start of Rome and not before. The events that took place before the power of Rome was completed are recorded, but not considered that start of the Roman history. It is not considered the start of their history because the build up to the full power of Rome was not in full effect at the time. Rome was under the rule of a monarchy and the republic or as Livy called it "new liberty" (Kelly, pg. 58) took control and started a better Rome. When the Roman Empire was in full swing of command and conquer with expansion as the priority.

The saying "all roads lead to Rome" is very important because no matter where a person was in the empire, Rome was always the true center in their hearts. This was the ideal for all Romans that are from Rome and have ties to the city. Romans that are from the city are the one that held some type of office or status moved away from Rome and put in charge of an area. The Roman military experienced on a regular basis with traveling to and from to forts or camps for an extended time. The Romans took over the area of the Mediterranean Sea and parts of what is now Europe, and made sure that Rome was the heart of the empire even though the city was not in the center. It is also a truth for the ages because hints of the Roman Empire are taken by every era and transformed what Romans did to change their own views. The most important way was the use of rhetoric.

###Rhetoric

The Romans were very good with rhetoric. It could be said that it started with underground while the monarchy rule was in power before the rise of the republic. To get the people behind an idea to overthrow is hard to do, but it was done. Being able to change the past from the rule of the monarchy and chose not to recognize it is what the people followed. All Caesars, senate members, and historians used the power of words that influenced the people like Livy and Cicero shaped the minds of many Romans. Caesar and members of the senate would speak to the people and soldiers of the republic of Rome for many reasons. For example, when Rome wanted to expand, Caesar would give a speech to the people on why expanding into an area was important, and is words would get the people on his side and Rome. Words that were very motivational and powerful assisted Caesar and the senate to enlarge the empire. (still looking for outside source)
 
It can be said that Roman rhetoric had a major influence on the Renaissance area after the fall of Rome. This was due to the writings of the Roman historians and the ability of public speaking. William Shakespeare one of the most profound English writers during the Renaissance area wrote plays that had Caesar in them. Garry Wills book called Rome and Rhetoric: Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar states, “Caesar was a commanding figure in the Renaissance imagination” (Wills, pg. 25). The Renaissance held Caesar in very high standards when power and leadership was to be given, or in the case of the play making Caesar the God like figure he was.
 
###Cicero
 
Kelly tells us the "first law" (Kelly, pg. 66) is to tell the truth no matter what. Cicero was another major Roman historian. He stated, “that an author must not dare to tell anything but the truth” (Kelly, pg. 66) because that was the job of the historian. Cicero along with Caesar gave very powerful speeches to the people. In some cases Caesar would put fear in the people of Rome, but Cicero would take every change to put the people at ease. Frank Marsh the author of The Founding of the Roman Empire stated about Cicero, “The powerful speech of Cicero may have done something to make compliance easier for some” (Marsh, pg.71). This shows just how great of speaker Cicero was to the people. He also used his words to take fear away from people and help out with law to be passed.

###Tacitus

Tacitus also wrote the history he lived. He was a politician and a military officer that wrote about what he experienced on the battlefield and in the senate. Tacitus to major works, “which covered the years of his own youth down to the death of Domitian, and the Annals, which was a richly detailed account of Roman history from A.D. 14 to 68” (Kelly, pg. 61). Tacitus followed Livy later on down the road, and wrote about the later history of Rome. He was the major historian for the decline and fall of Rome. He is one of the true writers of the fall because being in the system of politics; he saw what was wrong with the final stand of Rome

###Link to Christianity

One road that led to Rome is the road to religion. The Vatican and the Pope are in Rome and have been for a long time. St. Peter’s Basilica that stands today replaced the Old St. Peters Basilica that stood in the same place and began construction in the early 14th century and finished in the early to mid 15th century. The Vatican can be said to be one of the safest places on earth because The Vatican is surrounded by the city of Rome its self. It is protected and was built that way for the reason that it is the center and the heart of Christianity.
