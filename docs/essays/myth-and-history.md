# Myth and History

## How History Emerged From Myth

<p class="abstract">
(Still need an abstract)
</p>

### Introduction 

According to Kelley, history emerged from myth, and forced itself into stories and legends until it gained full insight (Kelley, 1). But when exactly did this happen? Was it during the time of Machiavelli, the well-known Italian Renaissance historian? Or Voltaire, the famous writer and historian during the French Enlightenment era? Or is it still gaining understanding in the current century? This question will probably never attain a definite answer. As long as there are people around to record it, the subject of history will forever be changing and gaining wisdom and knowledge by those studying it (Kelley, 1). 

### What is History?

What exactly qualifies as history, then? Arguably, the biggest form of history could actually be [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth). A myth or traditional story, by definition, concerns the early history of a group of people, and helps to explain some sort of natural or social occurrence. Another example would be an [epic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry), which typically discusses heroic deeds and events that are significant to the culture of the poet. *(Briefly discuss Homer here)*. Lists of priests and kings are also important forms of recorded history, because they each kept track of important people in different societies. Finally, the last significant form of history is [chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology), which observes the arrangement of events and keeps them all in order by the dates they occurred on. *(Briefly discuss Manetho and Ptahhotep here)*. All of these genres became a form of history before the term and concept of "history" even existed (Kelley, 3). Something else that Kelley points out is that we are never fully able to see past our own prejudices with either history or myth, but when it comes to "working on myth" or "historicizing", our prejudices allow us to remain critical of our work and question the sources we are using. Without our deepest prejudices present in our minds, we wouldn't be able to write history in the clearest way possible (Kelley, 1). 

### The Art of Writing History

The art of writing history involves three important factors, scope, method, and purpose. Scope involves subject matter, chronology, geography, and historical evidence that has been passed down through the generations verbally, or written down by scribes, which historians have found to be worthy or useful of making note of. Method involves the means of gathering the above information and making sense of it and even re-writing it, primarily to bring it into the public sphere. Finally, the last important factor is purpose. Purpose involves the value claimed for the study of history, and what would later become known as the [philosophy of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history). That is, history that takes a more theoretical approach. All three of these aspects can be projected on a small or large scale, and can be intended for local or global usage, depending on the historian and what his/her goals are for their work (Kelley, 7). These three things are important because they help us to understand and figure out what was important to different cultures across a broad timeframe. 

### The Ancient Egyptians

Historians have always attempted to relate human behavior and human nature with its environment, which also includes social and natural contexts that help to locate and distinguish it from other cultures and communities (Kelley, 8). The ancient Egyptians supplied many examples of historical inquiry and interpretation for historians over the course of time because they were a society that held a vast interest in the origins of the universe, their gods, genealogies, chronology, victories over their enemies, and the afterlife. {% include figure.html class="img-right" src="king-tut-with-gods.jpg" %} The [Palermo Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo_Stone) is one example of their efforts to record their history. The stone contains inscriptions of regnal lists on one of six fragments of a giant slab. Social memory during the time of the ancient Egyptians was embodied in architecture and funeral remains. Pyramids and monuments were used in ancient Egyptian myths to help preserve memories (Kelley, 13-14). 

#### **Manetho**

[Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) was a priest during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II, who lived in Sebennytos (the capital of ancient Egypt) during the 30th Dynasty, and is credited with writing the *Aegyptiaca*. Commissioned by Ptlomey II, the *Aegyptiaca* is a collection of three books that discuss the history of ancient Egypy. Ptlomey II wanted Manetho to compose these books to attempt to bring the Egyptians and Hellenistic cultures together. Since Manetho was a priest, he had easy access to a vast amount of different writings including myths, folklores, and magical and scientific practices. For this reason, Manetho mixed his available sources of the factual history of Egypt together with its mythologies. Perhaps the most special thing about the *Aegyptiaca* is that it has not yet been found, but has been referenced by the reputable early Christian historian, ***Josephus (link to Tiersa's essay?)*** (http://www.ancient-egypt.org/who-is-who/m/manetho.html).    

#### **Ptahhotep**

[Ptahhotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptahhotep) was an ancient Egyptian [vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier_(Ancient_Egypt)) who lived during the late 25th and early 24th centuries BC during the reign of Pharaoh Djedkare, the predecessor of Unis (http://www.maat.sofiatopia.org/ptahhotep.htm). He is known today for his writings in ancient Egyptian [wisdom literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature). He is credited with writing [*The Maxims of Ptahhotep*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maxims_of_Ptahhotep), which was used mostly by the young men of powerful families who would someday hold high political positions within their societies. Ptahhotep’s sayings stressed the importance of achieving one’s own obligations, remaining humble, being faithful, and being able to speak up or remain silent whenever necessary. *The Maxims of Ptahhotep* is likely the oldest and largest piece of ancient Egyptian wisdom literature to still exist, and is therefore a very important work to modern-day historians and scholars alike (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptahhotep). It is just one example of ancient Egyptian recorded history that places importance on chronology, and it also gives evidence to the morals that the ancient Egyptians placed great value in within their culture.  
	
### The Greeks

Philosophy and science made Greece the starting point for the story of the human condition in time (Kelley, 13). Proto-historiographical forms of writing in Greek culture included: Genealogy, a line of descent traced continuously from a specific ancestor. Geography, the study of human activity, including the distribution of populations and resources over time. Ethnography, the scientific description of the customs of different cultures and groups of people, and local history, the study of the patterns and behavior of the people in one’s own community. {% include figure.html class="img-right" src="The_Procession_of_the_Trojan_Horse_in_Troy_by_Giovanni_Domenico_Tiepolo.jpg" %} Like the Egyptians, the Greeks also expressed an interest in chronology. [Hellanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellanicus_of_Lesbos), a contemporary Greek writer, attempted to create a comparative study of the chronologies of the Greeks and barbarian tribes, but was ultimately unable to remove the mythical aspects from his work to make it more historically accurate. Examples of Greek mythology include both myths and teachings about their gods and heroes, the origins and importance of their own rituals and culture, and the nature of the world (Kelley, 15). 

#### **Homer**

(Still working on him)

#### **Herodotus**

[Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus), known as the "father of history" and the "father of lies," was a Greek historian who greatly enjoyed recording history by means of story-telling. The fact that he was a little too ambitious with his writings and made up many inaccurate details about different cultures heavily links him to the subjects of both myth and history. He was, however, the first historian to systematically collect sources, test the legitimacy of them (to an extent), and arranged his materials into well-constructed narratives/tales. He was also the first person to present the concept of a thesis into his writings (http://www.krauselabs.net/writings/herodotus-father-of-history/). His large-scale historical narrative has managed to survive throughout the centuries, and still influences the ways that history is recorded today (Kelley, 2-6). Herodotus was born in the Greek city of Halicarnassus in the year 484 BC to a wealthy merchant family. As an adult, he spent most of his time traveling through many Persian territories including Egypt, Babylon, Syria, and Palestine. He also wandered through Cyprus, Crete, Samos, and Aegina. Herodotus made a point of keeping track of and recording all the different myths, legends, and oral histories from the countries he visited. He spent the majority of his life working on, [*The Histories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)), originally published in 440 BC. In his works, Herodotus attempted to explain why the Persian Wars happened, or more specifically, what exactly caused both sides to want to fight against one another. He tried to explain the how and the why of the Persian Wars by giving firsthand accounts of the events of the war, but he also included myths and legends that he had recorded during his travels with his historical writings (http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/herodotus).

#### Thucydides

[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides), known as the "second founding father of history," concentrated his efforts on politics and the military. His writings on the [*History of the Peloponnesian War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War) rejected the story-telling narrative that Herodotus was so fond of, and eventually coined the term the Thucydidean Model, which included eyewitness testimony, personal experience, and observable facts (amongst other things) as a way of recording history. He approached his studies in a more analytical manner, thus allowing his readers to come up with their own conclusions from his works. Thucydides can be see as the first historian who really attempted to distinguish myth from history through his work (Kelley, 2-6). Not much is known about Thucydides except for what is mentioned in his own works. He was born in the year 460 BC in Halimos, a suburb of Athens. In 424 BC, he was put in charge of a military fleet, but failed to reach the city of Amphipolis in time to stop the Spartans from seizing it, and was exiled for 20 years. It was during these 20 years that Thucydides was able to research, collect data, and really perfect his historical anaylsis of the Peloponnesian Wars. Unlike Herodotus, Thucydides makes little to no references of the interference of the Greek gods in important historical events, instead choosing to look specifically at the human causes of war and conflict. By using this method, he was able to determine that the only logical reason for Athens falling to the Spartans was because of poor leadership and his societies moral decline (http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/thucydides).  

### Truth & Memory

The most essential theme to survive constant changes in language, culture, ideology, and human values is the issue of ***truth (link to Kyle's essay?)***, but what does truth mean? It has always exhibited different natures and histories, but each meaning is somehow always united into one single idea; truth is not a static value, and has its own kind of destiny (Kelley, 10-11). Concluding the truth depends on one’s perspective, and how they interpret the information that is given to them. What one person views as the truth could be another person proof of a lie.  

The experience of passing time cannot be captured, except for in language, which unfortunately offers a poor representation of individual memories and knowledge. History is often regarded to as a combination of different memories, but this causes more problems than it solves because memory is selective. For example, a huge problem that historians have to take into consideration is that stories that have been passed down through different generations have been changed multiple times, which makes it much more difficult to distinguish the made up parts from the parts that actually did occur (Kelley, 11).
