# Reforming History: 
## How the Reformation Altered the Purpose and Goal of History 

Reformation historiography largely centered around the revision of history, removing the elites as the sole makers and consumers of history.  Further this meant movement away from histories that centered around Rome and reinforced the authority of the Catholic church.  Additionally Protestant historians were attempting to write their religion into history and provide Protestantism with authority through origin stories.  However in the end, the Reformation because the catalyst for secular history and the professionalization of history as a profession.    

### The Reformation

The [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation) was a movement away from the Roman Catholic church due to a deep distrust in the church. This distrust came from years of grievances with the Catholic church that largely revolved around access to information and corruption. Martin Luther (1483-1546) and his 95 Theses are often cited as the beginning of the Reformation. In 1517 Luther was prompted to write his 95 Theses because of practices in the Catholic Church such as the purchasing of indulgences.  He saw these practices as a sign of the deep corruption within the church.   Luther’s basic premise, which was one of the fundamental pieces of Reformation ideology, was “every man a priest”, which essentially meant that the established hierarchy in the church wasn’t necessary. In fact the hierarchy of the Catholic church was seen as inherently wrong.  According to Catholic doctrine individuals must go through a priest to talk to God, however the Reformation stood for the proposition that every man could talk to God without a middle man. This undermined the hierarchy of the church and by extension the hierarchy of the state.  During this time the two entities were deeply intertwined while also competing for superior authority.    Such a dual construction of society, can be visualized by the **Gelasian** concept of the “two swords”. Essentially the idea was that there were “two swords”, the church and state, which competed for superior authority. Said competition ultimately shaped Europe. (I still haven’t found what Gelasian means, but I’m still looking. If I can’t find it I’ll get rid of this) Both were also strict hierarchies, so to call into question the hierarchy of one would be to question the hierarchy of both. In this way the Protestant Reformation challenged the church’s and state’s authority.

### Revisionism in the Reformation

The Reformation marked a **“massive project of revisionism, which proposed, first implicitly and then explicitly, to rewrite universal history so that it would convict the Roman hierarchy and justify the ‘true religion’”** (Kelley, 167). This was the ultimate of effect of the Reformation on historiography. Prior to the Reformation the hierarchy established by both the church and state was the foundation of all histories. Histories were written by and for the elite. All histories lead back to Rome and justified the Roman Catholic church. The Reformation’s fundamental goal was to undermine and convict and the long standing tradition of Roman and Catholic centered histories.  In part this was accomplished by historians such as Johann Sledian who were vehemently dedicated to impairitliaty. Sleidan was hired by the German princes to be the historiographer of the Reformation. His job was to discuss Luther in addition to the agenda and efforts of the Protestant party.  Sleidan personally felt convicted to recount a fair and equal telling of history.  A French historian by the name of Commynes wrote histories in which it was said that “in no way did her praise those of his own country or race, even kings who had raised him to high honor, unless it was true…, [and] everywhere he presented the facts in themselves” (Strasbourg, 1548). Sleidan sought to write these kinds of histories. Histories in which he didn’t praise any particular person or event because of a personal connection.  By writing impartial histories, for the first time the church and state were potentially exposed to negative work.  This allowed for the introduction of histories that didn’t center around the long standing elites. 

### Challenging Tradition 

An extension of the revisionism undertook during the Reformation was a distrust for tradition, which became the grounds to criticize the Catholic church. Such distrust was expressed by Dante who stated that **“Those who rely solely on the tradition, therefore, must be thrown out of the arena”**. Everything within the church operated based off of known traditions that had been around for generations. These traditions maintained the hierarchy and shaped histories. Because most individuals were illiterate, histories were for the very elite in society such as the clergy. Inevitably the intended audience generated histories that fit the elites perception of the world. The heaving influence of tradition on history, therefore was utilized to criticize not only the Pope but also the ecumenical council which was the chief rival to the pope’s authority. Further the conflict between the pope and council represented a tear in the Catholic church itself. The council represented another Catholic tradition which according to Reformation writers created a kind of faction within the Catholic church between the pope and the council. This faction represented the consequences of following tradition: discord that leads to failure.

### The Conflict with Human Traditions 

Another facet of tradition in Reformation history was human traditions. Protestant history became a kind of conflict between “spirit and letter”. That is to say history as the process of God’s Word and history as the product of human’s sin. One Reformation historian Melanchthon said “there has been no tradition, pious though it be in appearance, which has not wrought great evil for Christianity”. History was therefore often seen by Protestant historians as the degradation of the church. However historians in the strain of Johann Sleidan were more concerned with  the “truth”.  He once said that “Candor and truth are the two most becoming ornaments of a history” (Kass, 91).  While he was devoutly committed to the Reformation, he was also convicted that political history played an important role in religious history.  Both human’s and God’s history were intimately connected and with out one the other couldn’t be fully explained. In one of his books, Sleidan stated that “In the history of religion, I would not omit what concerned the civil government because they are interwoven with the other”. In other words, religious history is a product of its time and to omit civil history is to omit part of what created religious history. To report one or the other, would be simply reported only half of what happened.  The conflict between God’s history and human history will come into play later as Protestants try to constructs their origins.

Sleidan’s commitment to recounting both religious and civil history, speaks to what he believed was historical “truth”.  As was stated Sleidan believed that neither religious or civic history is complete without the other.  Later in his life, Sleidan wrote a friend asserting “I would rather die than say, still less write, anything without proof”.  Here religious history according to Sleidan was the history of human sin not the process of God’s Word. Truth was unbiased in Sleidan’s view. His dedication to the truth and impartial histories inevitably effected the way he wrote as he dealt with a changing society that exhibited a great deal of religious dissent.  For Sleidan, “truth” came from original sources and eyewitness accounts.  The belief that these two sources best reflected the truth appears to be a widely held conviction.  However eyewitness accounts, at least for Sleidan, came from only trusted peers or himself (Kass, 91-93).    

### Origins

As the Reformation began, Protestants had to construct their histories or origins. While it may seem obvious to say that Protestant history began with the Reformation, Protestant historians of the time would disagree. Protestants traced their history back to the ancient times. One such writer John Foxe stated that “we have the old actes and histories of auncient tyme to give testimonie with us…, to declare the same form, usage, and institution of this our Church reformed now, not to be the begynnyng of any new Churche of our owne, but to be the renewiyng of the old auncient Church of Christ”. The notion that the Protestant church was simply the resurgence of a church that existed in ancient times became the manner in which Reformation histories legitimized Protestantism as the “true religion”. Martyrs also became a part of the rhetoric involving Protestant origins. The belief that **“The blood of the martyrs, is the seed of the church”** was widely held. In part the purpose of this was to show the deep roots of the Protestant faith, however there is a certain amount of accusation that accompanies the martyr argument. Without really saying it, Protestant histories were saying that Catholics have been persecuting the “true religion” the whole time. Essentially the goal of Protestant history was to establish origins that legitimize the Protestant faith while simultaneously devaluing the Catholic faith. Protestant historians wanted to establish their religion as the ultimate source of truth
