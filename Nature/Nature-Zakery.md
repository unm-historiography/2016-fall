<b>Wilderness</b><br><br>
There’s a book called <i>The World Without Us</i>. I highly recommend it. <br><br>
“As we gaze into the mirror [nature] holds up for us, we too easily imagine that what we behold is Nature when in fact we see the reflection of our own unexamined longings and desires” (7) – this is the human experience, right? When nature is a certain way we feel some sort of uniqueness. We feel the divinity in nature, when, in reality, nature is just doing its thing, and we, as humans, are imposing our feelings and beliefs on, for example, an unusual setting sun. I think the intimate relationship between religious ideologies and nature is interesting. I suppose it makes sense from a fundamental view of the deals. There are both deals that humanity has a hard time explaining, so naturally they should be related.<br><br>
Nature is the number one victim of Progress, and, unfortunately, it becomes a resource for people to either cherish or capitalize. Damnit Nestle. You ruined everything. Nestle is the actual devil – you heard it here first. I think they mysteries of nature are put there upon humans. This unknown place where “God might show himself” (10). Of course, because that checks out. He should appear in the middle of nowhere for one person to witness, instead of appearing to huge nations of people. Let us go into the woods. Grandma’s house is out there, or the Big Bad Wolf, or the savages. I’m a savage. Seems fine.<br><br>
