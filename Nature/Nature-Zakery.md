<b>Wilderness</b><br><br>
There’s a book called [<i>The World Without Us</i>](http://www.worldwithoutus.com/index2.html). I highly recommend it. <br><br>
“As we gaze into the mirror [nature] holds up for us, we too easily imagine that what we behold is Nature when in fact we see the 
reflection of our own unexamined longings and desires” (7) – this is the human experience, right? When nature is a certain way we feel some sort of uniqueness. We feel the divinity in nature, when, in reality, nature is just doing its thing, and we, as humans, are imposing our feelings and beliefs on, for example, an unusual setting sun. I think the intimate relationship between religious ideologies and nature is interesting. I suppose it makes sense from a fundamental view of the deals. There are both deals that humanity has a hard time explaining, so naturally they should be related.<br><br>
Nature is the number one victim of Progress, and, unfortunately, it becomes a resource for people to either cherish or capitalize. Damnit Nestle. You ruined everything. Nestle is the actual devil – you heard it here first. I think they mysteries of nature are put there upon humans. This unknown place where “God might show himself” (10). Of course, because that checks out. He should appear in the middle of nowhere for one person to witness, instead of appearing to huge nations of people. Let us go into the woods. Grandma’s house is out there, or the Big Bad Wolf, or the savages. I’m a savage. Seems fine.<br><br>
We want to feel special or unique when we see some sort of natural phenomena – the moon being in just the right place between the trees, the sun setting upon your proposal, and so on. We think nature cares about us, but I’m not sure it does. I’m not sure we can make any real claims that It does. Because, again, all that is really happening is the universal orgy in space that we can’t even comprehend.<br><img align="right" src="http://www.ourladyofthesandias.org/_/rsrc/1318083494885/the-sandia-mountains/sandias.png"><br>
To be fair, I am not exempt from this. I do feel amazing when I bike home and I see the dust settling at the foot of the Sandia Mountains. 
It makes me wonder what the conquistadors saw, you know. It makes me feel safe, it makes me feel like I should write about it, but really it’s just happening, and I happen to be looking at it, and has been that way, and it will always be that way as long as the mountains are there and the earth spins the way it has been spinning for grillions of years. Why do we feel the need to paint this stuff? To make it Romantic. When really, a river is just a river. Hutton would be so proud that we are talking about Turner’s thesis. Nature happens to be the body and the object of the frontier myth. The last conquest. Manifest Destiny. You know, all that good stuff we learned when we were kids. What about space? Is space the next frontier? Are we going to forget about nature and start worrying about preserving space?<br><br>
And at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter if anything of these things are arbitrary or mythical. All that really matters is how people feel and assign meaning to these things. The <i>actual myth</i> doesn’t matter; it’s the thought that the myth provokes which matters; it’s the identity that comes with myth is what matters. It can be a lie; it can be a total lie. Seems fine.<br><br>
Gah, don't you just love this stuff. This whole blurring of lines between culture, progress, tradition, modernity. This is liquid modernity people!! – “If civilization was to be redeemed, it would be by men like the Virginian who could retain their frontier virtues even as they made the transition to post-frontier life” (14). We now enter a state of mind where we feel the need to have
all of the ideals exists together. The dichotomy. <br><br>
I think this was supposed to be 200 words. Jokes.<br><br>
>> <i>It is entirely a creation of the culture that holds it dear, a product of the very history it seeks to deny.
Indeed, one of the most striking proofs of the cultural invention of wilderness is its
thoroughgoing erasure of the history from which it sprang. In virtually all of its mani-
festations, wilderness represents a flight from history. Seen as the original garden, it is
a place outside of time, from which human beings had to be ejected before the fallen
world of history could properly begin. Seen as the frontier, it is a savage world at the
dawn of civilization, whose transformation represents the very beginning of the na-
tional historical epic. Seen as the bold landscape of frontier heroism, it is the place of
youth and childhood, into which men escape by abandoning their pasts and entering
a world of freedom where the constraints of civilization fade into memory. Seen as
the sacred sublime, it is the home of a God who transcends history by standing as the
One who remains untouched and unchanged by time's arrow. No matter what the
angle from which we regard it, wilderness offers us the illusion that we can escape the
cares and troubles of the world in which our past has ensnared us.</i><br><br>
