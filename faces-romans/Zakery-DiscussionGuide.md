<b>Faces of History</b><br>

Pg. 48-74<br><br>


¬	Gaius thought that “the most important part of anything is its beginning” (Faces 49). Although this is true, the author points out that “the zero point of history eludes us” (49). What is the significance, if any, is the beginning of time if no thought or memory exists of a time from ‘the beginning’? Looking at this in the more postmodern world we live in, is Gaius’s claim still applicable/relevant to History, or anything else for that matter?<br><br>

¬	After finishing the reading, I couldn’t help but feel like every historian critiqued the way of history that came before it – this is very similar to what we notice with literature and the various theories incorporated with specific eras. What does this say about the study of history? How can truth be critiqued?
