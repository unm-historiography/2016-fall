1. In the beginning of the chapter, Kelley discussed early historians impulsion to begin their study of history at the 
**“beginning”**.  Even today historian’s work begins with the origins of the event in question.  Why do historians have this 
impulse? Does discovering the beginning serve a *useful* purpose? And how does one know when they have really found the origins
of an event? 

2. On page 53 Sallust says that history is difficult because what ends up on paper needs to correspond with the facts, and also
because if a historian chooses to criticize an event he must worry about the response of the readers.  We have talked a lot 
about bias, does this difficulty that Sallust express increase that bias?  In other words, do you think historians did and do 
suppress some of their criticism in order to minimize negative response to their work?  If so, what are the implication of 
this on history.  

3. On page 63, Kelley quotes Momigliano who states that Tacitus had a specific aim in mind when writing his history.  Is this
motivation, like an individuals personal bias, impossible to get rid of?  If so, how does that further muddle the utility of 
history and our ability to discover the “truth”?

4. How does the rise and fall of social structures, such as the end of paganism, effect the *“truth”* or *“facts”* of history? 
During times such as these, tension and emotions tend to run high.  Does that make history as told by the people who lived 
through it **more** or **less** trustworthy?
