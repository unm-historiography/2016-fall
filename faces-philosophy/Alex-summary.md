- Kelley argues that "Humanity is like individual members of the species, and the experience of the human race over time is much like the life of a person, from generation and growth to, presumably if not predictably, corruption and death." (p. 217)

- Theophilus gale attempted to trace human literature back to the holy scriptures to create a history of human words and a "philosophical school." (p. 218)

- Humanist philosophy agrues "history produced no certainty...strewing partiality, prejudices, and falsehoods throughout the ages." (p. 219)

- The age of discovery began to inspire codification of historical methodology into various philosophically and/or scientifically oriented schools of thought aimed at explaining historical phenomenon.

- The 17th and 18th centuries began to see history as a "normal science" built on monastic traditions with the potential or impart wisdom on any who are willing to study it. Regardless of the nature of the historical record. (p. 220-221)

- The "normal science" of history adopted a "quasi-professional fascination with antiquity with antiquity" as a scientific and professional goal in the 17th and 18th century. Later history and philosophy would "diverge sharply." (p. 222)

- Giambattista Vico attempted to overlay chronology onto "universal history" in order to give temporal form to "the sacred history" by merging it with the "profane history." (p. 223) Vico was fascinated with questions of origins and prehistorical ages of myth. (p. 224)

"I think therefore I am" versus "I make therefore I know."

Gibbon and the End of Rome...

- Roman practice dominated historical/historiographical methodology for over 2 millennia but enlightenment era philosophical reinterpretation and questions of human origins overlaid onto national identities facilitated the decline and fall of Roman historical practice. (p. 227-232)

- Conjectural history purported using history as a tool to build a "science of human nature." French enlightenment philosophical history advocated not only understanding the natural world of humans but improving the world. Work on the history of the human spirit projected modern pedogogical and philosophical constructs back in time across the chronicle of humanity.

- Voltaire brought common sense and pragmatism and eloquence back to historical writing.

- Not surprisingly, German enlightenment historiographical practice retained strong protestant thematic elements. (p. 244)

- Herder concerned himself with making distinct connections between humanity and nature and analyzing how humans interact with nature.
