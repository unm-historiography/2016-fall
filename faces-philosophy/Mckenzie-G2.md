Although I'm still neutral whether our class creates a book or website, I know I'd like to make this a class project, not a partner project.  Working in small groups wouldn't be a bad way to organize this project, but since we have so many **different** opinions I believe working together as a class will produce the best results.
  - Pro: No individual meetings outside of class. Hearing multiple inputs is useful.  It will lead to a product this class is more pleased with.
  - Cons: It may be hard to come to one conclusion with issues in the book.  It may take longer.  We may develop *group think* and not produce a good website/book.
  
  Kelley's book isn't my favorite, but I like the chronological layout.  I learn history better when it's taught to me in order.  It's easier [for me] to see why certain things happened.  Where Kelley did wrong was in the amount of information he gives. 

I believe learning history in order from the Greeks to the Renaissance is important, but keeping it short is equally important. This doesnâ€™t mean we have to sacrifice key information, we just need to prioritize what is important and what is not. 

*A book with too much information is like getting a really long email, no one wants to read the whole thing, and you catch yourself skimming or zoning out.*
