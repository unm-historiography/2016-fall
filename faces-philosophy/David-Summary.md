* Enlightenment History likened human history **generally** to the experience of a human **individually**.
  * In particular, the "progress" of history, however this was measured, was akin to growing up, being an adult, growing old, and dying.
  
* There were many **prejudices**, some random examples of which are given on pg. 219. However historical scholarship was yet **cosmopolitan and international**.

* Motives were preserved; *glorify the state*, *defend the Church*, *enhancement of causes and instiutions*, etc., yet attempts were made to rise history to the **philosophical or theological** level as well.

* This was an age of **Crisis**, where various emerging positions attempted to use history to give themselves **legitimancy**. Pg. 221
  
  * This was mirrored in **National** histories. I saw them as being obssessed with legitimancy through **origin**. Pg. 222
    
    * Of course, this lead to prejudices and biases, as mentioned earlier, and of particular relevance here.
 
There was still an obsession with classical continuity and origins, particularly as pertains to said national narratives. 

* Vico in particular divided history into sacred and "profane" **ages and Epochs**, and attempts to create a **universal history** from such, crouching his claims in both biblical and classical materials Pg. 223-224. Rome was a major source of information to him.

* Gibbon emphasized analysis of Rome. Very dense sub-section, send help.

From here there is exploration of the methods of individual nations.

* Scottish historians emphasized the role of "**Human Nature**" in history, which had an undercurrent of the universality of human nature, though the source of influences and causes varied (Pages 234-237). In some ways it has elements of sociology (Page 234).

*  In French History we see an emphasis on **prediction** and the **future**; it is not enough to understand, but to improve (Page 238). Some authors emphasized prophesy (243), others emphasized broad analysis of history (242), but all were obsessed with progress and reason.

* German history placed more emphasis on culture, anthropology, etc.
