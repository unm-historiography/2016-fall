-History is a *western construction* to help us understand the unknown. History is simply a **myth**. Just like religions have *creation stories*, history is the *creation story of the West*.

-**Herodotus** and **Thucydides**, the fathers of history, exemplify two perspectives of history. These two perspectives have influenced historians to create what Kelly calls *‘kaleidoscopic’* faces of history.

-History is **not** an absolute truth but a means of *self-knowledge* and what the past *means* to each individual. 

-**Herodotus'** method was to reason with causes based upon eyewitness or hearsay testimony. He sought to be honest and objective but is considered by critics to be the ‘father of lies’ in that it is believed that he manipulated materials.

-**Thucydides'** method was focused on political and military history within Greece. He avoided myth and used eyewitness testimony of experiences of his own generation.

-The idea of history has developed into a *scientific historiography* from poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy.
