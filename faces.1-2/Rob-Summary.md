- On pg1 author Donald Kelley quotes David Hume, "Sceptical doubt...is a malady which can never be radically cured" and furthers this point by stating himself, "for we cannot see beyond our deepest prejudices, nor can we write history without them". 
- On pg7, Kelley lists there are three main questions that must be asked about history and how it is recorded. They are scope, methodology and purpose.


- Scope is subject matter, geography, historical evidence and chronology. 
-- Method involves the process of gathering all of the available (or chosen) material, interpreting it and turning it into a cohesive and useful product. 
-- Purpose refers to he utility of the study of history and would later be referred to as the philosophy of history.

-History has gone through many various eras, environments and contexts. As we study historiography, one of the most important tasks is to "explore and specify" these various cultural environments and contexts that shaped the authors and their historical works. Pg10  

-Herodotus and Thucydides, in many ways, are the fathers of history. Besides the early poets nobody, as a profession, looked to the past. Two very different approaches to looking at the past. p19-31
But both didn't give, "Much thought to the theoretical foundations of their historiographical practice". They simply set out to detail the "truth" in their own interpretation and preserve that for their peers and future readers. p42

-On page 47, Kelley citing Lucian of Samosata describes the ways in which a historian should perform their duties, "The task of the historian...is to tell what happened and not spend time in useless praise; his chief virtues are political understanding, which is a gift from nature, and literary power, which is a product of education and effort...the historian, out of respect for the facts, must follow it and worship only Truth. He should be a stranger, committed to no country, party, or patron and although he may report myths, he should not accept them...His writing must be like an undistorted mirror and, while distinguishing between virtue and vice, let the facts speak for themselves".
